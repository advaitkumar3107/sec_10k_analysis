</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication technique called CDMA
could be commercially successful in wireless communication applications. CDMA stands for Code
Division Multiple Access and is one of the main technologies currently used in digital wireless
communications networks (also known as wireless networks). CDMA and GSM (which is a form of TDMA
(Time Division Multiple Access) and stands for Global System for Mobile Communications) are the
primary digital technologies used to transmit a wireless device user&#146;s voice or data over radio
waves using the wireless network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we led, and continue to lead, the development and commercialization of CDMA
technology, we own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and
trade secrets, which applies to all versions of CDMA, portions of which we license to other
companies and implement in our own products. The wireless communications industry generally
recognizes that a company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA
technology will require a patent license from us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several versions of CDMA technology that have been adopted worldwide as public
cellular standards. The first version, known as cdmaOne, is a second-generation (2G) cellular
technology that was first commercially deployed in the mid-1990s. The other subsequent versions of
CDMA are popularly referred to as third-generation (3G) technologies known commonly throughout the
wireless industry as:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDMA2000 and WCDMA are deployed today in wireless networks throughout the world. In addition
to increasing voice capacity, these 3G CDMA technologies enable greater data capacity at higher
data rates. The CDMA2000 family includes CDMA2000 1X, EV-DO Release 0, Revision A and Revision B.
EV-DO technologies and future enhancements will allow wireless network operators (also known as
wireless operators) to introduce Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), multi-megabit-per-second data
speeds, multimedia and broadcast capabilities in the coming years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WCDMA family includes HSDPA, part of 3<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">rd</SUP> Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
Release 5, HSUPA, part of 3GPP Release 6, as well as HSPA&#043;, part of 3GPP Release 7. We expect
enhancements in future revisions of the 3GPP specifications will further increase performance
capacity and data speeds. We expect many WCDMA operators to upgrade their networks to HSUPA and
also HSPA&#043;. There are plans to deploy another 3G technology, TD-SCDMA, in China. CDMA2000 is
commercially available in China, and it is anticipated that WCDMA will be commercially launched as
well.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, we expect a broader range of airlinks will be utilized depending on the
spectrum availability and applications offered by each wireless operator. Wireless operators are
considering deploying technology based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA)
to complement their existing 3G networks to provide additional bandwidth for data communications.
3GPP is specifying an OFDMA system called Long Term Evolution (LTE), and 3<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">rd</SUP> Generation
Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) has developed the UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband) standard. OFDMA
technologies being standardized in the 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards bodies will support high data rates
in up to 20 megahertz (MHz) channels. Other OFDMA standards, specified by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), include 802.16 (WiMax) and 802.20. We have been
actively pursuing research and development of commercial OFDMA-based wireless communication
technologies and have cumulatively filed or acquired over 1,700 United States and 8,100 foreign
patent applications related to these technologies. We believe that each of these standards
incorporates our patented technologies. Thus far, we have signed eight companies to royalty-bearing
licenses under our patent portfolio for use in single-mode OFDMA products (i.e. OFDMA products that
do not implement CDMA-based standards). Multimode products, that implement both OFDMA and CDMA
technologies, will in most cases be licensed under our existing CDMA license agreements.

HSPA&#043; (3GPP Releases 7 and 8) and other future standards. These technologies support more efficient
voice communications, broadband access to the Internet, multimedia services, VoIP and other delay
sensitive applications (including video telephony, push-to-talk and multiplayer gaming) and other
revenue-generating services, in turn accelerating the growth of CDMA. At the same time, we are
working to fulfill the growing demand for affordable, voice-centric CDMA wireless devices within
the emerging entry-level market through various efforts including the introduction of Single Chip
(SC)&nbsp;solutions, streamlined test and certification processes and the aggregation of device
procurements. With regard to our 1xEV-DO technology, we have improved its value, performance and
economics with EV-DO Revision A, which provides a number of enhancements, including greater
spectral efficiency, faster reverse-link data rates, lower latency and optimized quality of
service. EV-DO Revision B enables CDMA operators to utilize a software upgrade to allow multiple RF
channels to transmit to a single device and hence significantly increase the user data rates (e.g.
three times in a 5 MHz bandwidth) and reduce latency for bursty applications. 3GPP standards are
also evolving beyond current HSDPA and HSUPA to offer HSPA&#043; that will enable much higher broadband
data rates and higher capacity voice services. We continue to play a significant role in the
development of and contributions to the 3GPP standards for HSPA&#043; and are developing chipset

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we continue to contribute to the 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards to enable the next
level of mobile broadband data services, based on OFDMA technologies. 3GPP is introducing an
OFDMA-based air interface
through the LTE standard to deliver higher mobile broadband data rates using channel
bandwidths up to 20 MHz. Using 20 MHz of bandwidth, LTE is targeted to support data rates up to 143
megabits per second (Mbps) on the downlink and 75 Mbps on the uplink with two base station antennas
and two handset antennas. Using the same bandwidths with four antennas at both the base station and
the device, LTE is targeted to support downlink peak data rates of up to 278 Mbps. Data rates will
be less with lower bandwidths. In April&nbsp;2007, 3GPP2 published the first version of UMB, an
OFDMA-based specification. UMB is a broadband air interface using primarily OFDMA, but also
incorporating CDMA. We expect the performance for UMB and LTE to be similar for a given
configuration of spectrum and antennas. These standards also enable end-to-end Internet Protocol
(IP)&nbsp;transport using an advanced IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)&nbsp;platform to deliver voice (VoIP),
multimedia and other broadband data services cost effectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTE and UMB have been proposed to be part of the International Mobile Telecommunications
Union-2000 (IMT-2000) specification as part of the normal update process. Multiple wireless
operators, including Verizon and Vodafone, have communicated their commitment to LTE as their next
generation technology path.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TDD version of WiMax was accepted as the sixth air interface in the IMT-2000 family using
the name OFDMA TDD WMAN (Wireless Metropolitan Area Network). Initial systems utilizing the 802.16e
WiMax standard were commercially launched in 2008. These systems are targeted at TDD spectrum and
higher frequency bands (e.g. 2.5 and 3.5 gigahertz (GHz)). Similarly, WiBRO, a variant of WiMax,
has been deployed in South Korea at 2.3 GHz with limited commercial success. Since the WiMax family
of standards has evolved from a wire line legacy, we believe that, in the near future, the
efficiency and mobility likely will not be as robust as those technologies that were designed from
the ground up for mobile broadband (i.e. LTE and UMB). For example, the two South Korean WiBRO
carriers, KTF and SK Telecom, have recently announced that WiBRO will not be extended to carry
voice traffic and will be limited to data traffic only due to technical limitations and business
considerations. Furthermore, the 3G economies of scale greatly improve the availability and cost
structure of 3GPP and 3GPP2 evolved technologies. The OFDMA family of standards is expected to be
complementary with 3G services, and we expect to provide multimode chipsets capable of operating
across multiple CDMA- and OFDMA-based technology deployment scenarios.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of
their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating
broadband data services ahead of their competition. Our patented technologies, resulting from our
strong investment in fundamental system research and development, have been and are expected to
continue to play a significant role in each of these future standards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi, are complementary to Wide Area Networks
(WAN), such as CDMA2000 and WCDMA. CDMA2000 and WCDMA both provide affordable high-speed wireless
access to the Internet today. The limited coverage offered by Wi-Fi is well suited for private
networks (e.g. enterprises, campuses and homes) and certain public &#147;hot spots&#148; (e.g. airports,
conference halls and coffee shops) where data usage is high in a limited portable and stationary
environment. 3G CDMA networks, on the other hand, are ideally suited for geographically diverse
voice and data coverage (e.g. cities, highways and neighborhoods) and in environments where public
access to the Wi-Fi network is blocked due to a firewall (e.g. a client&#146;s enterprise). We may
incorporate WLAN technology into our future multimode 3G CDMA chipsets as we continue to identify
and integrate other complementary wireless technologies into our chipsets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing our MediaFLO MDS and OFDM-based FLO technology to optimize the low cost
delivery of multimedia content to multiple wireless subscribers simultaneously, otherwise known as
multicasting. As part of the standardization of FLO technology, the FLO Forum (www.floforum.org)
was established in May&nbsp;2005. To date, more than 90 companies have joined the FLO Forum. In 2005,
the TIA established a Committee to develop standards for Terrestrial Mobile Multimedia Multicast.
In August&nbsp;2006, TIA published the Standard Forward Link Only Air Interface Specification based upon
the FLO Forum&#146;s submissions, thus standardizing the lower layers of the FLO air interface. The TIA
has published a total of eight standards relating to the MediaFLO MDS technology and several other
standards are currently in development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to develop our interferometric modulator (IMOD)&nbsp;display technology based on a
micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS)&nbsp;structure combined with thin film optics, and early-stage
IMOD displays have been incorporated in a limited number of commercial devices. IMOD display
technologies may be included in the full range of consumer-targeted mobile products and is expected
to provide performance, power consumption and cost benefits as compared to current display
technologies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the tremendous demand for wireless voice services, wireless service providers
are increasingly focused on providing broadband wireless access to the Internet, as well as
multimedia entertainment, messaging, mobile commerce and position location services. These services
have been aided by the development and commercialization of 3G wireless networks and 3G devices
which are capable of supporting higher data rates that incorporate an ever-increasing array of new
features and functionality, such as assisted Global Positioning System (GPS)-based position
location, digital cameras with flash and zoom capabilities, internet browsers, e-mail, interactive
games, music and video downloads and software download capability (e.g. our BREW platform). In
October&nbsp;2008, the Yankee Group, a global market intelligence and advisory firm in the technology
and telecommunications industries, estimated that more than 2.9&nbsp;billion people will be using mobile
data services by 2012 and the revenue produced from these services will account for 24% of total
wireless service revenue worldwide. We believe the growing availability of 3G-enabled devices
capable of performing a wide variety of consumer and enterprise applications will accelerate the
demand for many wireless data services on a global basis and thus lead to an increased replacement
rate of 2G mobile devices to 3G mobile devices using our technologies and integrated circuits.
Affordable wireless broadband data connectivity is important to the consumer and enterprise, and
its demand will continue to drive the evolution of wireless standards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of wireless standards for mobile communications within individual countries is
generally determined by the telecommunication service providers operating in those countries and,
in some instances, local government regulations. Such determinations are typically based on
economic criteria and the service provider&#146;s evaluation of each technology&#146;s ability to provide the
features and functionality required for its business plan. More than two decades ago, the European
Community developed regulations requiring the use of the GSM standard, a TDMA-based technology.
According to Wireless Intelligence, the use of this 2G wireless standard has spread throughout the
world and is currently the basis for approximately 80% of the digital mobile communications in use.
With the deployment of WCDMA, a 3G CDMA-based technology, by GSM operators, many of the current 3
billion GSM subscribers are expected to upgrade to 3G wireless services in order to enjoy the added
features and functionality available with 3G systems, among other things. For instance, a worldwide
forecast published by Strategy Analytics in June&nbsp;2008 indicated that the total number of WCDMA
(UMTS)&nbsp;subscribers will grow from 340&nbsp;million at the end of 2008 to over 2.2&nbsp;billion by the
beginning of 2013.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant growth in the use of wireless devices worldwide and demand for enhanced
network functionality requires constant innovation to further improve network reliability, expand
capacity and introduce new types of services. To meet these requirements, progressive generations
of wireless telecommunications technology standards have evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Second Generation. </I></B>Compared to first generation analog systems, 2G digital technology provided
for significantly enhanced efficiency within a fixed spectrum resulting in greatly increased voice
capacity. 2G technologies also enabled numerous enhanced services, including paging, e-mail,
facsimile, connections to computer networks, greater privacy, lower prices, a greater number of
service options and greater fraud protection. However, data services (e-mail, fax, computer
connections) were generally limited to low speed transmission rates. The main 2G digital cellular
technologies are called cdmaOne or IS-95A/B, a technology we developed and patented, North American
TDMA, PDC (Personal Digital Cellular, a variant of North American TDMA), and GSM, also a form of
TDMA. At this time, sales of North American TDMA and PDC phones have been discontinued with
subscribers being moved to GSM or 3G technologies. Many wireless operators have plans to shut down
usage of these 2G systems. Similarly, analog systems have been shut down in many places. In the
United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&nbsp;began permitting wireless operators to
shut down the analog system in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Third Generation. </I></B>As a result of demand for wireless networks that simultaneously carry both
high speed data and voice traffic, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a standards
setting organization, adopted the 3G standard known as IMT-2000, which encompasses six terrestrial
operating radio interfaces, three of them based on our CDMA intellectual property. One other is
OFDMA-based, and the other two are TDMA-based.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advantages of 3G CDMA technology over both analog and TDMA- and GSM-based
technologies include increased network capacity, network flexibility, compatibility with internet
protocols, higher capacity for data and faster access to data (Internet) and higher data throughput
rates. GSM has the benefits of more widespread roaming availability due to its wider worldwide
deployment. Handset selling price was once considered an advantage of GSM, however, low-priced
CDMA2000 handsets of $20 or less (wholesale sales price) are available today, further enabling
wireless CDMA growth in developing regions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current commercial versions of CDMA2000 (1X and 1xEV-DO) provide both voice and high-speed
wireless data communications. Position location technology, accomplished through a hybrid approach
that utilizes signals from both the GPS satellite constellation and CDMA2000 cell sites, enables
CDMA2000 network operators to meet the FCC mandate requiring wireless operators to implement E-911
wireless emergency location services and offer other commercial location-based services. In the
future, updates of CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO are expected to further increase capacity and
performance. Other enhancements, such as multicast services, higher-resolution displays,
improvements to extend battery life, push-to-talk services and VoIP are becoming available to
improve the user experience and operator profitability. The price differential between low-end 3G
CDMA2000 devices and GSM devices is diminishing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GSM operators around the world, including those in the European Community and AT&#038;T in the
United States, have focused primarily on the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access-Frequency Division
Duplexing (UTRA-FDD) radio interface of the IMT-2000 standard, known as WCDMA (standardized as
UMTS), which is based on our underlying CDMA technology and incorporates many of our patented
inventions (as are all of the CDMA radio interfaces of the IMT-2000 Standard). The majority of the
world&#146;s leading wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers (more than 95) have licensed our
technology for use in WCDMA products, enabling them to utilize this WCDMA mode of the 3G
technology.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of GSM operators deployed second and a half generation (2.5G) mobile packet data
technologies, such as GPRS and EDGE in areas serviced by GSM, as a bridging technology, while they
waited for 3G WCDMA devices to become more readily available and affordable so they can justify the
expense of upgrading their GSM system to provide WCDMA service. In some regions of the world,
regulatory restrictions have prevented deploying WCDMA in the lower frequency bands used by GSM,
thus requiring more cell sites for WCDMA to provide coverage. As a result, in less dense areas,
some wireless operators have not deployed WCDMA. From a technological perspective, we do not
believe that GPRS and EDGE effectively compete with 3G CDMA-based packet data services, either on a
cost per bit transmitted or performance basis. The European Union permitted IMT-2000 technologies,
which include WCDMA, to be deployed in the lower frequency 900 MHz band. This is called UMTS900.
Commercial deployments of UMTS900 began in November&nbsp;2007, and we expect to see further deployments
utilizing the advantages of UMTS900.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three ITU 3G CDMA radio interfaces are all based on the underlying core principles of CDMA
technology; however, the CDMA2000 mode enables a direct and more economical conversion for current
cdmaOne networks. While the WCDMA wireless air interface does use CDMA technology for
communications between the wireless device and the network, the core network has been specifically
designed to be compatible with the GSM core network, which is why GSM operators will migrate to
WCDMA rather than to CDMA2000<B>. </B>Our intellectual property rights include a valuable patent portfolio
essential to implementation of each of the 3G CDMA alternative standards and patents that are
useful for commercially successful product implementations. Generally, we have licensed
substantially all of our patents to our CDMA subscriber and infrastructure equipment licensees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 3G CDMA versions (CDMA2000, WCDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) from a technological
perspective require separate implementations and are not interchangeable. While the fundamental
core technologies are derived from CDMA and, in addition to other features and functionality, are
covered by our patents, they each require unique infrastructure products, network design and
management. However, subscriber roaming amongst systems using different air interfaces is made
possible through multimode wireless devices.

CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications,
multimedia functions and global positioning system products. QCT&#146;s integrated circuit products and
system software are used in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, data cards and
infrastructure equipment. These products provide customers with advanced wireless technology,
enhanced component integration and interoperability and reduced time-to-market. QCT markets and

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate
foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made.
Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test
manufacturing processes. Die cut from silicon wafers are the essential components of all of our
integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We rely on
independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the
testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most
of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and
two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our
foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits.
Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing
foundries and contract with separate third party manufacturers for back-end assembly and test
services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as Integrated Fabless
Manufacturing (IFM). Our fabless model provides us the flexibility to select suppliers that offer
advanced process technologies to manufacture, assemble and test our integrated circuits at a

OmniExpress, T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS and QConnect products and services, as well as over six key
competitors to our GlobalTRACS system. Internationally, we face several key competitors in Europe
and Mexico. These competitors are offering new value-added products and services similar in many
cases to our existing or developing technologies. Emergence of new competitors, particularly those
offering low cost terrestrial-based products and current as well as future satellite-based systems,
may impact margins and intensify competition in new markets. Similarly, some original equipment
manufacturers of trucks and truck components are beginning to offer built-in, on-board
communications and position location reporting systems that may impact our margins and intensify
competition in our current and new markets. We are currently in discussions with some trucking
manufacturers about using our products as their embedded solution.

strategic relationships among themselves or with our existing or potential customers, resellers or
other third parties. These relationships may affect customers&#146; decisions to purchase products or
license technology from us or to use alternative technologies. Accordingly, new competitors or
alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to our
detriment. In addition, many of these companies are licensees of our technologies and have
established market positions, trade names, trademarks, patents, copyrights, intellectual property
rights and substantial technological capabilities. We may face competition throughout the world
with new technologies and services introduced in the future as additional competitors enter the
marketplace for products based on 3G standards or other wireless technologies. Although we intend

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and proprietary
information to maintain and enhance our competitive position. We have cumulatively filed or
acquired approximately 8,900 United States patent applications, of which approximately 2,900
patents have been issued. The vast majority of such patents and patent applications relate to
digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be
relevant to CDMA2000, UMTS, TD-SCDMA, TD-CDMA and OFDMA products. We also have and will continue to
actively file for broad patent protection outside the United States. We have cumulatively filed or
acquired approximately 44,000 foreign patent applications, of which approximately 14,300 patents
have been issued, with broad coverage throughout most of the world, including China, Japan, South
Korea, Europe, Brazil, India, Taiwan and elsewhere.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G
standards that are based on CDMA. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to
license our essential patents for these CDMA standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from
unfair discrimination. We have also informed standards bodies that we may hold essential
intellectual property rights for certain standards that are based on OFDMA technology, e.g.
802.16e, 802.16m, 802.20, UMB and LTE.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation.
These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to wireless
technology. Because all commercially deployed forms of CDMA and their derivatives require the use
of our patents, our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed portfolio in the
industry with over 155 licensees. Over the years a number of companies have challenged our patent
position but at this time most, if not all, companies recognize that any company seeking to
develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technologies will require a patent license
from us. In all cases we have licensed our patented technologies to interested companies on terms
that are fair, reasonable and free from unfair discrimination. Unlike some other companies in our
industry that hold back certain key technologies, we offer interested companies the opportunity to
license essentially our entire patent portfolio for use in subscriber devices and cell site
infrastructure equipment. Our broad licensing strategy has been a catalyst for industry growth,
helping to enable a wide range of companies offering a broad array of wireless products and
features while driving down average and low-end selling prices for 3G handsets and other wireless
devices. By licensing a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications,
supporting equipment manufacturers with a total chipset and software solution, and focusing on
improving the efficiency of the airlink for wireless operators, we have helped 3G&nbsp;CDMA evolve,
grow, and reduce device pricing all at a faster pace than the second generation technologies that
preceded it (e.g. GSM).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our license agreements, licensees are generally required to pay us a license fee as well
as ongoing royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of certain
permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.), of subscriber and
infrastructure equipment and/or a fixed per unit amount. License fees are paid in one or more
installments, while royalties generally continue throughout the life of the licensed patents. We
believe that our licensing terms are reasonable and fair to the companies that benefit from our
intellectual property and provide significant incentives for others to invest in CDMA (including
WCDMA) applications, as evidenced by the significant growth in the CDMA portion of the wireless
industry and the number of CDMA participants. Our license agreements generally provide us rights to
use certain of our licensees&#146; technology and intellectual property rights to manufacture and sell
certain products, e.g. Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and related software,
subscriber units and/or infrastructure equipment. In most cases, our use of our licensees&#146;
technology and intellectual property is royalty free. However, under some of the licenses, if we
incorporate certain of the licensed technology or intellectual property into certain products, we
are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our strategy to generate licensing revenues and support worldwide adoption of our
CDMA technology, we license to other companies the rights to design, manufacture and sell products

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Businesses</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>If deployment of our technologies does not expand as expected, our revenues may not grow as
anticipated.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus our business primarily on developing, patenting and commercializing CDMA technology
for wireless telecommunications applications. Other digital wireless communications technologies,
particularly GSM technology, have been more widely deployed than CDMA technology. If adoption and
use of CDMA-based wireless communications standards do not continue in the countries where our
products and those of our customers and licensees are sold, our business and financial results
could suffer. If GSM wireless operators do not select CDMA for their networks or update their
current networks to any CDMA-based third-generation (3G) technology, our business and financial
results could suffer since we have not previously generated significant revenues from single-mode
GSM product sales. In addition to CDMA technology, we continue to invest in developing, patenting
and commercializing OFDMA technology, which has not yet been widely adopted and commercially
deployed, and FLO technology, which was commercially deployed in the United States in fiscal 2007.
If OFDMA is not widely adopted and commercially deployed and/or FLO technology is not more widely
adopted by consumers in the United States or commercially deployed internationally, our investments
in OFDMA and FLO technologies may not provide us an adequate return.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business and the deployment of our technologies, products and services are dependent on
the success of our customers, licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators, as well as the timing of
their deployment of new services. Our licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators may incur lower
operating margins on products or services based on our technologies than on products using
alternative technologies as a result of greater competition or other factors. If CDMA-based
wireless operators, wireless device and/or infrastructure manufacturers cease providing CDMA-based
products and/or services, the deployment of CDMA technology could be negatively affected, and our
business could suffer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>We are dependent on the commercial deployment and upgrades of 3G wireless communications equipment,
products and services to increase our revenues, and our business may be harmed if wireless network
operators delay or are unsuccessful in the commercial deployment or upgrade of 3G technology or if
they deploy other technologies.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase our revenues in future periods, we are dependent upon the commercial deployment
and upgrades of 3G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA
technology. Although wireless network operators have commercially deployed CDMA2000 and WCDMA, we
cannot predict the timing or success of further commercial deployments or expansions or upgrades of
CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA systems. If existing deployments are not commercially successful or
do not continue to grow their subscriber base, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000, WCDMA
or other CDMA-based systems are delayed or unsuccessful, our business and financial results may be
harmed. In addition, our business could be harmed if wireless network operators deploy other
technologies or switch existing networks from CDMA to GSM without upgrading to WCDMA or if wireless
network operators introduce new technologies. A limited number of wireless operators have started
testing OFDMA technology, but the timing and extent of OFDMA deployments is uncertain, and we might
not be successful in developing and marketing OFDMA products.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Our patent portfolio may not be as successful in generating licensing income with respect to other
technologies as it has been for CDMA-based technologies.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to GSM, GPRS,
EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA and/or Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO)&nbsp;technologies, our patent portfolio
licensing program in these areas is less established and might not be as successful in generating
licensing income as our CDMA portfolio licensing program. Sprint Nextel entered into a definitive
agreement with Clearwire Corporation to form a new company that has started to deploy WiMax (an
OFDMA-based technology) using its 2.5 GHz spectrum, also known as the Broadband Radio Services
band.&nbsp;Other wireless operators are investigating deployment of WiMax or considering LTE, being
standardized by 3GPP, or UMB, being standardized by 3GPP2, as next-generation technologies for
deployment in existing or future spectrum bands. Verizon has announced its intention to begin
developing its chosen fourth generation (4G) technology, LTE, during 2008 and to prepare for the
time when its customers start demanding such 4G capabilities, while continuing the expansion and
operation of its existing CDMA-based technologies for many years to come. Although we believe that
our patented technology is essential and useful to implementation of the WiMax, LTE and UMB
standards and have granted royalty-bearing licenses to eight companies to make and sell products
implementing those standards, we might not achieve the same royalty revenues on such WiMax, LTE or
UMB deployments as on CDMA/WCDMA, and we might not achieve the same level of success in WiMax, LTE
or UMB products as we have in CDMA/WCDMA products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Our earnings are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues and earnings have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate
significantly in the future. General economic or other conditions could cause a downturn in the
market for our products or technology. The recent financial disruption affecting the banking system
and financial markets and the concern as to whether investment banks and other financial
institutions will continue operations in the foreseeable future have resulted in a tightening in
the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in
fixed income, credit and equity markets. In addition to the current impact on our marketable
securities portfolio, there could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on our
business that could also adversely affect our operating results. The credit crisis may result in
the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; the inability of our customers to
obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer insolvencies that cause our
customers to change delivery schedules, cancel or reduce orders without incurring significant
penalties as they are not subject to minimum purchase requirements; a slowdown in global economies
which could result in lower consumer demand for CDMA-based products; counterparty failures
negatively impacting our treasury operations; increased impairments of our investments; and the
inability to utilize federal and/or state capital loss carryovers. Net investment income could vary
from expectations depending on the gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities,
gains or losses from equity method investments, impairment charges related to marketable
securities, interest rates and changes in fair values of derivative instruments. Our cash and
marketable securities investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating
or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements and financial market conditions in
fixed income and equity securities. The current volatility in the financial markets and overall
economic uncertainty increase the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our
earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future operating results will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to:
our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated customers or licensees, both domestically and
internationally; our ability to develop, introduce and market new technology, products and services
on a timely basis; management of inventory by us and our customers and their customers in response
to shifts in market demand; changes in the mix of technology and products developed, licensed,
produced and sold; seasonal customer demand; and other factors described elsewhere in this Annual
Report and in these risk factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors affecting our future earnings are difficult to forecast and could harm our
quarterly and/or annual operating results. If our earnings fail to meet the financial guidance we
provide to investors, or the expectations of investment analysts or investors in any period,
securities class action litigation could be brought against us and/or the market price of our
common stock could decline.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect
our revenues and operating results.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe the recent global economic conditions are causing current
contraction in the channel inventory and will likely result in lower
consumer demand and prices for
our products and for the products of our customers, particularly wireless communications equipment
manufacturers or other members of the wireless industry, such as wireless network operators. We
cannot predict other negative events that may have adverse effects on
the economy, on demand and prices for wireless device products or on wireless device
inventories at CDMA-based equipment manufacturers and wireless operators. Inflation and/or
deflation and economic recessions that adversely affect the global
economy and capital markets also adversely affect our customers and our end consumers. For example, our customers&#146; ability
to purchase our products and services, obtain financing and upgrade wireless networks could be
adversely affected, leading to cancellation or delay of orders for our products. Also, our end consumers&#146; standards of
living could be lowered, and their ability to purchase wireless devices based on our technology
could be diminished. Inflation could also increase our costs of raw materials and operating
expenses and harm our business in other ways, and deflation could reduce our revenues if product
prices fall. Any of these results from worsening global economic
conditions could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2008, 70% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in
South Korea, Japan and China, as compared to 69% and 70% during fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.
These customers sell their products to markets worldwide, including in Japan, South Korea, China,
India, North America, South America and Europe. A significant downturn in the economies of Asian
countries where many of our customers and licensees are located, particularly the economies of
South Korea, Japan and China, or the economies of the major markets they serve would materially
harm our business. In addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and
military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of war or terrorism, may cause
disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and create
uncertainties. Should such negative events occur, subsequent economic recovery might not benefit us
in the near term. If it does not, our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating
results may be impaired. In addition, because we intend to continue to make significant investments
in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing
customer service and support capability, any decline in the rate of growth of our revenues
will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.

2007 and 26% in fiscal 2006. The loss of any one of our major customers or any reduction in the
demand for devices utilizing our CDMA technology could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to
achieve or sustain desired levels of operating results.</I>

temporary, or cancellation of significant orders from any of these customers would reduce our
revenues in the period of the cancellation or deferral and harm our ability to achieve or sustain
expected levels of operating results. We derive a significant portion of our QCT segment revenues
from two major customers. Accordingly, unless and until our QCT segment diversifies and expands its
customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of any future
purchase orders from these customers. Factors that may impact the size and timing of orders from
customers of our QCT segment include, among others, the following:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our QTL segment today derives royalty revenues primarily from sales of CDMA products by our

fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may create uncertainty about
our future business

may result in legal decisions and/or political actions by foreign governments that harm our
business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small number of companies have initiated various strategies in an attempt to renegotiate,
mitigate and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual
property in order to negatively affect our business model and that of our other licensees. These
strategies have included (i)&nbsp;litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such
companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion and patent and license unenforceability, or some form
of unfair competition, (ii)&nbsp;taking questionable positions on the interpretation of contracts with
us, with royalty reduction as the likely true motive, (iii)&nbsp;appeals to governmental authorities,
such as the complaints filed with the European Commission (EC)&nbsp;during the fourth calendar quarter
of 2005 and with the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC)&nbsp;and the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC)
during 2006, (iv)&nbsp;collective action intended to depress license fees, including working with
carriers, standards bodies, other like-minded technology companies and other organizations, formal
and informal, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices which could have the effect of
limiting returns on intellectual property innovations and (v)&nbsp;lobbying with governmental regulators
and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the imposition of some form of compulsory
licensing and/or to weaken a patent holder&#146;s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return
for such rights. A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the
policies of certain standards development organizations concerning the licensing of patents that
are or may be essential to industry standards and our alleged failure to abide by these policies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six companies (Nokia, Ericsson, Panasonic, Texas Instruments, Broadcom and NEC) submitted
separate formal complaints to the Competition Directorate of the EC accusing our business
practices, with respect to licensing of patents and sales of chipsets, to be in violation of
Article&nbsp;82 of the EC treaty. We received the complaints, submitted a response and have cooperated
with the EC in its investigation. On October&nbsp;1, 2007, the EC announced that it had initiated a
proceeding though it has not decided to issue a Statement of Objections, and it has not made any
conclusions as to the merits of the complaints. On July&nbsp;23, 2008, we entered into an agreement with
Nokia in which Nokia agreed to withdraw its complaint as part of the settlement of disputes between
the parties; however, although Nokia has withdrawn its complaint, the investigation remains active.
While the EC&#146;s actions to date do not indicate that the EC has found any evidence of a violation by
us and we believe that none of our business practices violate the legal requirements of Article&nbsp;82
of the EC treaty, if the EC determines liability as to any of the alleged violations, it could
impose fines and/or require us to modify our practices. Further, the continuation of this
investigation could be expensive and time consuming to address, divert management attention from
our business and harm our reputation. Although such potential adverse findings may be appealed
within the EC legal system, an adverse final determination could have a significant negative impact
on our revenues and/or earnings. We understand that two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and
Broadcom) and two South Korean companies (Nextreaming Corp. and Thin Multimedia, Inc.) have filed
complaints with the KFTC alleging that our business practices are, in some way, a violation of
South Korean anti-trust regulations. To date, we have not received the complaints but have
submitted certain requested information and documents to the KFTC regarding rebates on chipset
sales, chipset design integration and royalties on devices containing a Qualcomm chipset. The JFTC
has also received unspecified complaints alleging that our business practices are, in some way, a
violation of Japanese law. We have not received the complaints but have submitted certain requested
information and documents to the JFTC regarding the non-assert and royalty provisions in our
license agreements and BREW agreements. While we have not seen any of these complaints in South
Korea or Japan, we believe that none of our business practices violate the legal requirements of
South Korean competition law or Japanese competition law. However, we have cooperated with the
investigations of these complaints in South Korea and Japan, and any continuation or expansion of
these investigations could be expensive and time consuming to address, divert management attention
from our business and harm our reputation. An adverse final determination on these charges could
have a significant negative impact on our business, including our revenues and/or earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we believe that these challenges are without merit, and we will continue to
vigorously defend our intellectual property rights and our right to continue to receive a fair
return for our innovations, the distractions caused by challenges to our business model and
licensing program are undesirable and the legal and other costs associated with defending our
position have been and continue to be significant. We assume, as should investors, that such
challenges will continue into the foreseeable future and may require the investment of substantial
management time and financial resources to explain and defend our position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive and could
divert our valuable resources.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use
of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the
steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary
information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our
proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws. We cannot be
certain that the laws and policies of any country, including the United States, or the practices of
any of the standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement
or licensing, issuance of wireless licenses or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in a
way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of our patents and patent applications relate to our wireless communications
technology and much of the remainder of our patents and patent applications relate to our other
technologies and products. We may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights,
protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a
result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents or incur
substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our intellectual property
rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn,
could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights
could impair our brand identity.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, that patents on which we
rely are invalid, or that our business practices are in some way unlawful could adversely affect
our business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other
intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other
technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our
involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues
and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found
to infringe on another company&#146;s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction
or required to redesign our products, which could be costly, or to license such rights and/or pay
damages or other compensation to such other company. If we were unable to redesign our products or
license such intellectual property rights used in our products, we could be prohibited from making
and selling such products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that we will continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front
of administrative bodies (such as the U.S. International Trade Commission) to defend against patent
assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive
advantage or negotiating leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful and, if we
are not, the range of possible outcomes includes everything from a royalty payment to an injunction
on the sale of certain of our chipsets (and on the sale of our customers&#146; devices using our
chipsets) and the imposition of royalty payments that might make purchases of our chipsets less
economical for our customers. A negative outcome in any such litigation could severely disrupt the
business of our chipset customers and their wireless customers, which in turn could hurt our
relationships with our chipset customers and wireless operators and could result in a decline in
our share of worldwide chipset sales and/or a reduction in our licensees&#146; sales to wireless
operators, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, intellectual property rights claims in our industry are common, and, as the
number of competitors or other patent holders in the market increases and the functionality of our
products expands to include additional technologies and features, we may become subject to claims
of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others. Any claims,
regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert
the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays,
any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results. In any potential
dispute involving other companies&#146; patents or other intellectual property, our chipset customers
could also become the targets of litigation. Any such litigation could severely disrupt the
business of our chipset customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could hurt
our relationships with our chipset customers and wireless operators and could result in a decline
in our chipset market share and/or a reduction in our licensees&#146; sales to wireless operators,
causing a corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of other companies have claimed to own patents essential to various CDMA standards,
GSM standards and implementations of OFDM and OFDMA systems. If we or other product manufacturers
are required to obtain additional licenses and/or pay royalties to one or more patent holders, this
could have a material adverse
effect on the commercial implementation of our CDMA or multimode products and technologies,
demand for our licensees&#146; products, and our profitability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these and other factors, our competitors may be more successful than us. In
addition, we anticipate additional competitors will begin to offer and sell products based on 3G
standards. These competitors may have more established relationships and distribution channels in
markets not currently deploying CDMA-based wireless communications technology. These competitors
also may have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or
with our existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may
affect our customers&#146; decisions to purchase products or license technology from us or to use
alternative technologies. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge
and rapidly acquire significant market share of sales to our detriment. In addition to the
foregoing, we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting
that we develop products, including chipsets, that will operate in an &#147;open source&#148; environment,
which offers practical accessibility to a product&#146;s source code. Developing open source compliant
products, without imperiling the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business
depends, may prove difficult under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive
disadvantage for new product designs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue to believe our QMT Division&#146;s IMOD displays will offer compelling advantages
to users of displays, there can be no assurance that other technologies will not continue to
improve in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our IMOD displays. Sales of flat
panel displays are currently, and we believe will likely continue to be for some time, dominated by
displays based on liquid crystal display (LCD)&nbsp;technology. Numerous companies are making
substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics of, LCDs.
Additionally, several other flat panel display technologies have been, or are being, developed,
including technologies for the production of organic light-emitting diode (OLED), field emission,
inorganic electroluminescence, gas plasma and vacuum fluorescent displays. In each case, advances
in LCD or other flat panel display technologies could result in technologies that are more cost
effective, have fewer display limitations, or can be brought to market faster than our IMOD
technology. These advances in competing technologies might cause display manufacturers to avoid
entering into commercial relationships with us, or not renew planned or existing relationships with
us. Our QMT Division had $277&nbsp;million in assets (including $134&nbsp;million in goodwill) at September
28, 2008. If we do not achieve adequate market penetration with our IMOD display technology, our
assets may become impaired, which could negatively impact our operating results.

(SDOs&#146;) and other industry forums&#146; intellectual property policies could impact our licensing
business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies
for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations, some of which would require a maximum
aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all essential patents owned by all of
the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant
standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to
each member company with essential patents based upon the size of its essential patent portfolio.
In May&nbsp;2007, seven companies (Nokia, Nokia-Siemens, NEC, Ericsson, SonyEricsson, Alcatel-Lucent,
and Nextwave) issued a press release announcing their commitment to the principles described above
with respect to the licensing of patents essential to LTE and inviting all other industry
participants to join them in adopting such policies. Although the European Telecommunications
Standards Institute (ETSI)&nbsp;IPR Special Committee and the Next Generation Mobile Network industry
group have thus far determined that such proposals should not be adopted as amendments to existing

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>We depend upon a limited number of third-party suppliers to manufacture and test component parts,
subassemblies and finished goods for our products. If these third-party suppliers do not allocate
adequate manufacturing and test capacity in their facilities to produce products on our behalf, or
if there are any disruptions in the operations, or the loss, of any of these third parties, it
could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers, reduce our revenues,
increase our cost of sales and harm our business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A supplier&#146;s ability to meet our product manufacturing demand is limited mainly by its overall
capacity and current capacity availability. Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part,
on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers. A
reduction or interruption in our product supply
source, an inability of our suppliers to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in
component prices could have a material adverse effect on our business or profitability. Component
shortages could adversely affect our ability and that of our customers to ship products on a timely
basis and, as a result, our customers&#146; demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or
declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain desired
levels of profitability. Additionally, failure to meet customer demand in a timely manner could
damage our reputation and harm our customer relationships. Our operations may also be harmed by
lengthy or recurring disruptions at any of our suppliers&#146; manufacturing facilities and by
disruptions in the distribution channels from our suppliers and to our customers. Any such
disruptions could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products
from an affected manufacturer to another manufacturer. If the affected supplier was a sole-source
supplier, we may not be able to obtain the product without significant cost and delay. The loss of
a significant third-party supplier or the inability of a third-party supplier to meet performance
and quality specifications or delivery schedules could harm our ability to meet our delivery
obligations to our customers and negatively impact our revenues and business operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QCT Segment.</I>&nbsp;Although we have entered into long-term contracts with our suppliers, most of
these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments, except as may be provided in a
particular purchase order that has been accepted by our supplier. To the extent that we do not have
firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period, or in any specific quantity, our
suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of
products for their other customers while reducing capacity to manufacture our products.
Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or available at
reasonable prices. We have experienced capacity limitations from our suppliers, which resulted in
supply constraints and our inability to meet certain customer demand. There can be no assurance
that we will not experience these or other supply constraints in the future, which could result in
our failure to meet customer demand.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our goal is to establish alternate suppliers for technologies that we consider
critical, some of our integrated circuits products are only available from single sources, with
which we do not have long-term capacity commitments. Our reliance on sole- or limited-source
suppliers involves significant risks including possible shortages of manufacturing capacity, poor
product performance and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and
yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. Our arrangements with our suppliers may oblige us to
incur costs to manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases
in pricing to our customers which may result in lowering our operating margins. In addition, the
timely readiness of our foundry suppliers to support transitions to smaller geometry process
technologies could impact our ability to meet customer demand, revenues and cost expectations. The
timing of acceptance of the smaller technology designs by our customers may subject us to the risk
of excess inventories of earlier designs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a loss of, or a decision to change, a key third-party supplier, qualifying a
new foundry supplier and commencing volume production or testing could involve delay and expense,
resulting in lost revenues, reduced operating margins and possible loss of customers. We work
closely with our customers to expedite their processes for evaluating new integrated circuits from
our foundry suppliers; however, in some instances, transition of integrated circuit production to a
new foundry supplier may cause a temporary decline in shipments of specific integrated circuits to
individual customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM)&nbsp;model, we purchase die from semiconductor
manufacturing foundries, contract with separate third-party manufacturers for back-end assembly and
test services and ship the completed integrated circuits to our customers. We are unable to
directly control the services provided by our semiconductor assembly and test (SAT)&nbsp;suppliers,
including the timely procurement of packaging materials for our products, availability of assembly
and test capacity, manufacturing yields, quality assurance and product delivery schedules. We have
a limited history of working with the SAT suppliers under the IFM model, and cannot guarantee that
our lack of control will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to
meet our delivery obligations to our customers, reduce our revenues, or increase our cost of sales.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant part of our strategy involves our continued pursuit of growth opportunities in a
number of international market locations. We market, sell and service our products internationally.
We have established sales offices around the world. We expect to continue to expand our
international sales operations and to sell products in additional countries and locations. This
expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully
develop direct and indirect international sales and support channels, and we cannot assure you that
we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the amount of any
resulting revenues. If we are not able to maintain or increase international market demand for our
products and technologies, we may not be able to maintain a desired rate of growth in our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our international customers sell their products to markets throughout the world, including
China, India, Japan, South Korea, North America, South America and Europe. We distinguish revenues
from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software
or services are delivered and, for QTL&#146;s licensing and royalty revenues, the invoiced address of
our licensees. Consolidated revenues from international customers as a percentage of total revenues
were 91% in fiscal 2008 and 87% in both fiscal 2007 and 2006. Because a significant portion of our
foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, our products and those of our customers and
licensees that are sold in U.S. dollars become less price-competitive in international markets if
the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, and our revenues may not
grow as quickly as they otherwise might in response to worldwide growth in wireless products and
services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many international markets, barriers to entry are created by long-standing relationships
between our potential customers and their local service providers and protective regulations,
including local content and service requirements. In addition, our pursuit of international growth
opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before we realize returns,
if any, on our investments. Our business could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we engage in acquisitions or strategic transactions or make investments

mutual and exchange traded funds, corporate bonds/notes, auction rate securities and
mortgage/asset-backed securities. Many of our strategic investments are in CDMA wireless operators,
early-stage companies or venture funds to support our business, including the global adoption of
CDMA-based technologies and related services. Most of our strategic investments entail a high
degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if
at all. Our acquisitions or strategic investments (either those we have completed or may undertake
in the future) may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use
of our technologies. In addition, our other investments may not generate financial returns or may
result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation
expectations. In some cases, we make strategic investments in early-stage companies, which require
us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies. Our share of
any losses will adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to
these investments.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only
when the products are in use. For example, as our chipset product complexities increase, we are
required to migrate to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes. The
design process interface issues are more complex as we enter into these new domains of technology,
which adds risk to yields and reliability. Because our products and services are responsible for
critical functions in our customers&#146; products and/or networks, such defects or errors could have a
serious impact on our customers, which could damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships
and expose
us to liability. Defects or impurities in our components, materials or software or those used
by our customers or licensees, equipment failures or other difficulties could adversely affect our
ability, and that of our customers and licensees, to ship products on a timely basis as well as
customer or licensee demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or declines in demand could
reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain desired levels of profitability. We
and our customers or licensees may also experience component or software failures or defects that
could require significant product recalls, reworks and/or repairs that are not covered by warranty
reserves and which could consume a substantial portion of the capacity of our third-party
manufacturers or those of our customers or licensees. Resolving any defect or failure related
issues could consume financial and/or engineering resources that could affect future product
release schedules. Additionally, a defect or failure in our products or the products of our
customers or licensees could harm our reputation and/or adversely affect the growth of 3G wireless
markets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our products and those of our licensees and
customers entail the risk of product liability. The use of wireless devices containing our products
to access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system software in those devices to
viral or malicious attacks. We continue to expand our focus on this issue and take measures to
safeguard the software from this threat. However, this issue carries the risk of general product
liability claims along with the associated impacts on reputation and demand. Although we carry
product liability insurance to protect against product liability claims, we cannot assure you that
our insurance coverage will be sufficient to protect us against losses due to product liability
claims, or that we will be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost.
Furthermore, not all losses associated with alleged product failure are insurable. Our inability to
maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to protect ourselves in other ways against potential
product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products and those
of our licensees and customers and harm our future operating results. In addition, a product
liability claim or recall, whether against our licensees, customers or us could harm our reputation

services.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MediaFLO USA business is a wholesale provider of a mobile entertainment and information
service to our wireless operator partners.&nbsp;As such, we do not set the retail price of our service
to the consumer, nor do we directly control all of the marketing and promotion of the service to
the wireless operator&#146;s subscriber base.&nbsp;Therefore, we are dependent upon our wireless operator
partners to price, market and otherwise promote our service to the end users.&nbsp;If our wireless
operator partners do not effectively price, market and otherwise promote the service to their
subscriber base, our ability to achieve the subscriber and revenue targets contemplated in our
business plan will be negatively impacted.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Consumer acceptance and adoption of our MediaFLO technology and mobile commerce applications will

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer acceptance of the services our MediaFLO and Firethorn businesses offer is, and will
continue to be, affected by technology-based differences and by the operational performance,
quality, reliability and coverage of our wireless network and services platforms. Consumer demand
could be impacted by differences in technology, coverage and service areas, network quality,
consumer perceptions, program and service offerings and rate plans. Our wireless operator and
financial services partners may have difficulty retaining subscribers if we are unable to meet
subscriber expectations for network quality and coverage, customer care, content or security.
Obtaining content for our MediaFLO USA business that is appealing to subscribers on economically
rational terms may be limited by our content provider partners&#146; inability to obtain the mobile
rights to such programming. An inability to address these issues could limit our ability to expand
our subscriber base and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, adoption and
deployment of our MediaFLO technology could be adversely impacted by government regulatory
practices that support a single standard other than our technology, wireless operator selection of
competing technologies or consumer preferences.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth and/or increased their
international activities, placing significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial
resources. In order to manage growth and geographic expansion, we must continue to improve and
develop our management, operational and financial systems and controls, including quality control
and delivery and service capabilities. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our
employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and
inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology
transitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that
demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and
licensees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, inaccuracies in our demand forecasts, or failure of the systems used to develop
the forecasts, could quickly result in either insufficient or excessive inventories and
disproportionate overhead expenses. If we ineffectively manage our growth or are unsuccessful in
recruiting and retaining personnel, our business and operating results will be harmed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are required to estimate and record compensation expense in the statement of operations for
share-based payments, such as employee stock options, using the fair value method. This method has
a significant effect on our reported earnings, although it will not affect our cash flows, and
could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial
results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the values of share-based payments.
If factors change and/or we employ different assumptions or different valuation methods in future
periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from amounts recorded
previously, which could negatively affect our stock price and our stock price volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility that we
will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in
future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share-based payments. It may also
result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and
assumptions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical valuation models and market-based methods are evolving and may result in lower or
higher fair value estimates for share-based compensation. The timing, readiness, adoption, general
acceptance, reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain. Sophisticated mathematical
models may require voluminous historical information, modeling expertise, financial analyses,
correlation analyses, integrated software and databases, consulting fees, customization and testing
for adequacy of internal controls. Market-based methods are emerging that, if employed by us, may
dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative
expenses. The uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the
benefits to our investors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe
our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation
could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and
accruals. In such case, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period
or periods in which that determination is made could result. In addition, tax rules may change that
may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For
example, we consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be
invested indefinitely outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash
generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for
United States federal and state or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our future reported financial results may be
adversely affected if&nbsp;tax or accounting rules regarding unrepatriated earnings&nbsp;change&nbsp;or
if&nbsp;domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless
networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry
and adversely affect our business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that
utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators
must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in
the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated
to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital
required to: obtain licenses to use new frequencies; deploy wireless networks to offer voice and
data services; expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services; and obtain new
subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow
the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional
capital necessary to implement or expand 3G wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely
affected if this occurs.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>If wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect
of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which may decrease demand for our products and those
of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have
updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio
equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have
requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health
concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also
been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the
use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these
expressions of concern could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and
customers in the United States as well as foreign countries.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our OmniTRACS and OmniVision systems operate on leased Kurtz-under band (Ku-band) satellite
transponders in the United States, Mexico and Europe. Our primary data satellite transponder and
position reporting satellite transponder lease for the system in the United States runs through
September&nbsp;2012 and includes transponder and satellite protection (back-up capacity in the event of
a transponder or satellite failure). The transponder lease for the system in Mexico runs through
April&nbsp;2010 and does not currently have back-up capability. Our agreement with a third party to
provide network management and satellite space (including procuring satellite space) in Europe
expires in February&nbsp;2013. We believe our agreements will provide sufficient transponder capacity
for our OmniTRACS and OmniVision operations through the expiration dates. A failure to maintain
adequate satellite capacity could harm our business, operating results, liquidity and financial
position. QES terrestrial-based products rely on wireless terrestrial communication networks
operated by third parties. The unavailability or nonperformance of these network systems could harm
our business. The products and services that we sell for use on Globalstar Inc.&#146;s (Globalstar)
low-Earth-orbit satellite network are dependent on the availability and performance of the
Globalstar satellite system.&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2007, Globalstar announced that many of its satellites
were experiencing an anomaly resulting in degraded performance of the amplifiers for the S-band
satellite communications antenna, which, if not remedied, could have a significant adverse impact
on Globalstar&#146;s ability to provide uninterrupted two-way voice and data services on a continuous
basis in any given location.&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2007, Globalstar announced that
eight Globalstar satellites were successfully launched, and stated that it believes the
additional satellites will augment the current operating constellation and improve two-way voice
and data services until the launch of the second-generation satellite constellation, which is
scheduled to begin in the summer of 2009. If the launch of the satellites does not remedy the
problem or if Globalstar is unable to launch a second-generation satellite constellation, this
degraded performance will have an adverse impact on sales of our products and services that rely on
the Globalstar network.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MediaFLO network and systems currently operate in the United States market on a leased
Ku-band satellite transponder. Our primary program content and data distribution satellite
transponder lease runs through December&nbsp;2012 and includes transponder and satellite protection
(back-up capacity in the event of a transponder or satellite failure), which we believe will
provide sufficient transponder capacity for our United States MediaFLO service through fiscal 2012.
Additionally, our MediaFLO transmitter sites are monitored and controlled by a variety of
terrestrial-based data circuits relying on various terrestrial and satellite communication networks
operated by third parties. A failure to maintain adequate satellite capacity or the unavailability
or nonperformance of the terrestrial-based network systems could have an adverse effect on our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our board members, executive
officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability
to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. In addition, implementing our
product and business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, and our revenues
are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for such specialized
engineering and other talented employees in our industry is extremely competitive. In addition,
existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled
foreign national graduates of U.S. universities, making the pool of available talent even smaller.
Key employees represent a significant asset, and the competition for these employees is intense in
the wireless communications industry. In the event of a labor shortage, or in the event of an
unfavorable change in prevailing labor and/or immigration laws, we could experience difficulty
attracting and retaining qualified employees. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource
needs, particularly in engineering, through fiscal 2009. If we are unable to attract and retain the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in periods of poor
operating performance given the significant use of incentive compensation by our competitors. We do
not have employment agreements with our key management personnel and do not maintain key person
life insurance on any of our personnel. To the extent that new regulations make it less attractive
to grant share-based awards to employees or if stockholders do not authorize shares for the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On May&nbsp;18, 2005, Broadcom filed two actions
(the 467 case and the 468 case) in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California against the Company alleging infringement of ten patents and seeking monetary damages
and injunctive relief based thereon. On the following day, Broadcom also filed a complaint in the
United States International Trade Commission (ITC)&nbsp;alleging infringement of the five patents at
issue in the 468 case seeking a determination and relief under Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of
1930. Allegations relating to two of the Broadcom patent claims filed in the 468 case (which is
stayed pending completion of the ITC action) have been dismissed by agreement of the parties. In
the 467 case, one patent was stayed due to a pending reexamination of the claims by the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO), and another was dismissed by agreement of the parties. A trial
relating to the three remaining Broadcom patents in the 467 case was held in May&nbsp;2007, and on May
29, 2007, the jury rendered a verdict finding willful infringement of the
three patents and awarding past damages in the approximate amount of $20&nbsp;million (the court
subsequently vacated the jury&#146;s finding of willfulness). The final judgment, including damages
calculations through May&nbsp;29, 2007 and pre-judgment interest, was approximately $25&nbsp;million, which
has been secured by an irrevocable letter of credit and expensed pending appeals. On December&nbsp;31,
2007, the court issued an order, amended by the court for a second time on March&nbsp;11, 2008,
enjoining the Company from making, using, selling, shipping, supporting or marketing products that
were found to infringe the three Broadcom patents, subject to a specified limited license through
January&nbsp;2009 on two of the three patents and with respect to the third patent, a limited license as
to one set of products. The immediately enjoined products were those WCDMA products that related to
patent number 6,847,686 (the &#145;686 patent). With respect to EV-DO products involving the &#145;686 patent
(as well as products relating to the two remaining patents), the judge&#146;s order provided for a
permanent injunction but stayed the effect of that injunction until January&nbsp;31, 2009 with respect
to companies that purchased those enjoined products as of May&nbsp;29, 2007. The stay was subject to
certain conditions, including the Company&#146;s payment of ongoing royalties. Since the second
amendment of the injunction order in March&nbsp;2008, Broadcom filed a motion requesting that Qualcomm
be found in contempt of the order on various bases. The court denied the motion in part but granted
the motion with respect to the claim that Qualcomm should not have paid for WCDMA chips sold
between the date of trial verdict and the injunction, and should not have serviced and supported
products using such chips, and that Qualcomm should have paid certain royalties on revenue relating
to the QChat product. Since the order, on September&nbsp;24, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) issued its opinion in the appeal resulting from the trial
of the 467 case, upholding the verdict and remedies as to two patents and overturning the verdict
and remedy as to the &#145;686 patent, finding it invalid. As a result, the district court has issued a
third amended injunction order excluding any reference to the invalid patent and amended the
contempt findings relating to the invalidated patent. Broadcom has been ordered to repay royalties
relating to that patent. Qualcomm has also since filed a notice of appeal as to the contempt ruling
and has sought leave from the Federal Circuit for an extension of time to file a motion for a
rehearing with respect to issues on the appeal. That extension was granted. Broadcom has filed
another motion seeking a ruling that Qualcomm is in violation of the injunction order with respect
to certain sales and royalties Broadcom claims are owed under the order. Finally, the patent that
was subject to the stay pending reexamination in the USPTO has since emerged from the reexamination
process with certain claims cancelled and other claims added. A schedule for the litigation of that
patent has not yet been determined, but it is expected to occur in the last half of calendar 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;14, 2006, an ITC hearing also commenced as to three patents alleged by Broadcom to
be infringed by the Company. On October&nbsp;10, 2006, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&nbsp;issued an
initial determination in which he recommended against any downstream remedies and found no
infringement by the Company on two of the three remaining patents and most of the asserted claims
of the third patent. The ALJ did find infringement on some claims of one patent. The ALJ did not
recommend excluding chips accused by Broadcom but, instead, recommended a limited exclusion order
directed only to chips that are already programmed with a specific software module and recommended
a related cease and desist order. The Commission adopted the ALJ&#146;s initial determination on
violation and, on June&nbsp;7, 2007, issued a cease and desist order against the Company and an
exclusion order directed at chips programmed with specific software and certain downstream products
first imported after the date of the exclusion order. The Federal Circuit issued stays of the
exclusion order with respect to the downstream products of all of the Company&#146;s customers that
requested the stay. The Company appealed the infringement finding, the cease and desist

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">order and
the exclusion order, and Broadcom appealed certain rulings of the ALJ. Oral arguments took place on
July&nbsp;8, 2008 in the Federal Circuit. On September&nbsp;19, 2008, the Federal Circuit ruled on Broadcom&#146;s
appeal of the ITC&#146;s determination of no violation as to two patents (the &#145;311 patent and the &#145;675
patent). The Federal Circuit affirmed the ITC&#146;s determination as to the &#145;311 patent and affirmed
the findings on the &#145;675 patent with respect to seven of eight products at issue. As to the latter
patent, the court remanded for further proceedings the claims with respect to one accused product.
On October&nbsp;2, 2008, the USPTO issued a final office action in the reexamination of the &#145;311 patent,
rejecting certain of the claims, including all of the claims at issue in the ITC action, and
allowing other claims added by Broadcom. On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Broadcom filed an enforcement
complaint in the ITC, alleging violations of the ITC&#146;s cease and desist order by the Company. A
hearing on the complaint took place on April&nbsp;22 through April&nbsp;24, 2008. The target date for
completion of the investigation is August&nbsp;30, 2009. On October&nbsp;14, 2008, the Federal Circuit issued
an opinion upholding the ITC&#146;s finding that the Company did not directly infringe the &#145;983 patent;
vacating and remanding the ITC&#146;s finding that the Company indirectly induced infringement of the
&#145;983 patent; and vacating and remanding the limited exclusion order. The Federal Circuit held that
the ITC lacked authority to enjoin products of Qualcomm&#146;s customers pursuant to a limited exclusion
order because Broadcom had not named those customers as respondents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;13, 2007, Broadcom filed a new complaint in California state court against the
Company alleging unfair competition, breach of contract and fraud, and seeking injunctive and
monetary relief. On October&nbsp;5, 2007, the court ordered the case stayed pending resolution of the
New Jersey case, referenced below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the District
of New Jersey against the Company alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and unfair
competition laws as well as common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip sales
activities, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September&nbsp;1, 2006, the
New Jersey District Court dismissed the complaint; Broadcom appealed. On September&nbsp;4, 2007, the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reinstated two of the eight federal claims and five pendant
state claims in Broadcom&#146;s complaint and affirmed the dismissal of the remaining counts. On
November&nbsp;2, 2007, Broadcom filed an amended complaint, adding the allegations from the state court
case in California (filed on April&nbsp;13, 2007) that had been stayed, as discussed above, and a
federal antitrust claim based on the California allegations. On August&nbsp;12, 2008, the New Jersey
Court ordered the case transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California. No trial date has been set.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2008, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California seeking declaratory relief regarding patent misuse, patent
exhaustion and patent and license unenforceability. The Company has not yet responded to the
complaint.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation: </I>On October&nbsp;14, 2005, the Company filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom
alleging infringement of two patents, each of which relates to video encoding and decoding for
high-end multimedia processing, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon.
In January&nbsp;2007, a jury rendered a verdict finding the patents valid but not infringed. In a
subsequent ruling, the trial judge held that the Company was not guilty of inequitable conduct
before the USPTO, but the Company&#146;s actions in a video-encoding standards development organization
amounted to a waiver of the right to enforce the patents under any circumstances. The court also
ordered the Company to pay Broadcom&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees and costs for the case. The Company and
Broadcom each filed notices of appeal, but Broadcom subsequently dismissed its appeal. Oral
argument in the Federal Circuit was held on August&nbsp;5, 2008. On January&nbsp;7, 2008, the Magistrate
Judge considering Broadcom&#146;s motions for sanctions against the Company for discovery violations
issued an order sanctioning the Company and eight of its retained outside attorneys for those
discovery violations. The Magistrate Judge referred the eight outside attorneys to the California
State Bar for an investigation into possible ethics violations and ordered the Company to
participate in a process to create a model discovery protocol. The Magistrate Judge reaffirmed the
District Court&#146;s previous award of Broadcom&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees. On March&nbsp;5, 2008, the District Court
vacated the portion of the Magistrate Judge&#146;s order only as it relates to the sanctions imposed on
the Company&#146;s outside counsel and remanded the case to the Magistrate Judge for further proceedings
on those issues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>European Commission Complaint: </I>On October&nbsp;28, 2005, it was reported that six companies
(Broadcom, Nokia, Texas Instruments, NEC, Panasonic and Ericsson) filed complaints with the
European Commission, alleging that the Company violated European Union competition law in its WCDMA
licensing practices. The Company has received the complaints and has submitted replies to the
allegations, as well as documents and other information requested by the European Commission. On
October&nbsp;1, 2007, the European Commission announced that it was initiating a proceeding, though it
has not decided to issue a Statement of Objections, and it has not made any conclusions as to the
merits of the complaints. As part of its agreement with the Company, Nokia has withdrawn the
complaint it filed with the European Commission, although that investigation remains active.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tessera, Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On April&nbsp;17, 2007, Tessera, Inc. filed a patent
infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas and a
complaint with the ITC pursuant to Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the Company and
other companies, alleging infringement of two patents relating to semiconductor packaging
structures and seeking monetary damages and injunctive and other relief based hereon. The District
Court suit for damages is stayed pending resolution of the ITC proceeding. The ITC instituted the
investigation on May&nbsp;15, 2007. The patents at issue are being reexamined by the USPTO based on
petitions filed by a third-party. The USPTO&#146;s Central Reexamination Unit has issued office actions
rejecting all of the asserted patent claims on the grounds that they are invalid in view of certain prior art.
Tessera is contesting these rejections, and the USPTO has not made a final decision. On February
26, 2008, the ALJ stayed the ITC proceedings pending completion of the USPTO&#146;s reexamination
proceedings. On March&nbsp;27, 2008, the Commission reversed the ALJ&#146;s order and ordered the ITC
proceeding to be reinstated. The evidentiary hearing occurred on July&nbsp;14 through July&nbsp;18, 2008, and
the investigation is targeted for completion by April&nbsp;3, 2009.

wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in purported class action
lawsuits, and individually filed actions pending in Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., seeking
monetary damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. The courts that have reviewed similar
claims against other companies to date have held that there was insufficient scientific basis for
the plaintiffs&#146; claims in those cases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2008, two complaints were filed in San Diego Federal Court and San Diego Superior
Court on behalf of purported classes of individuals who purchased UMTS devices or service, seeking
damages and injunctive relief under federal and/or state antitrust and unfair competition laws as a
result of the Company&#146;s licensing practices. The Superior Court action has been removed to the San
Diego Federal Court, and the plaintiff&#146;s request for remand has been denied. The Company has filed
motions to dismiss the complaints.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company understands that two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and Broadcom) and two South

Fair Trade Commission alleging that the Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation
of South Korean anti-trust regulations. To date, the Company has not received the complaints but
has submitted certain requested information and documents to the Korea Fair Trade Commission
regarding rebates on chipset sales, chipset design integration and royalties on devices containing
a QUALCOMM chipset.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japan Fair Trade Commission has also received unspecified complaints alleging the
Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation of Japanese law. The Company has not
received the complaints but has submitted certain requested information and documents to the Japan
Fair Trade Commission.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the claims made by other parties are without merit and will
vigorously defend the actions. Other than amounts relating to the <I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM
Incorporated </I>matter, the Company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated
with the other legal proceedings described above based on the Company&#146;s belief that additional
liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be
estimated at this time. The Company is engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of its business and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on its operating results, liquidity or financial position.

payable on January&nbsp;7, 2009 to stockholders of record as of December&nbsp;11, 2008. We intend to continue
to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash
dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among
other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to
research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution
channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, changes in
federal income tax law and changes to our business model.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We primarily issue stock options under our share-based compensation plans, which are part of a
broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees
and directors and align stockholder and employee interests.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to our 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2006 Plan), we grant options to selected
employees, directors and consultants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less
than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The 2006 Plan provides for the grant
of both incentive and non-qualified stock options as well as stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares and other stock-based awards.
Generally, options outstanding vest over five years and are exercisable for up to 10&nbsp;years from the
grant date. The Board of Directors may terminate the 2006 Plan at any time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information regarding our stock option plans and plan activity for fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual
Report in &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7 &#150; Employee Benefit Plans&#148; and in our
2009 Proxy Statement under the heading &#147;Equity Compensation Plan Information.&#148;

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;11, 2008, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $2.0&nbsp;billion
of our common stock with no expiration date. The $2.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program replaced a
$3.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program, of which $2&nbsp;million remained authorized for repurchase. We
did not repurchase any of our shares under the $2.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Performance Measurement Comparison of Stockholder Return</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following graph compares total stockholder return on our common stock since September&nbsp;28, 2003
to two indices: the Standard&nbsp;&#038; Poor&#146;s 500 Stock Index (the S&#038;P 500) and the Nasdaq Total Return
Index for Communications Equipment Stocks, SIC 3660-3669 (the Nasdaq Industry). The S&#038;P 500 tracks
the aggregate price performance of the equity securities of 500 United States&nbsp;companies selected by
Standard&nbsp;&#038; Poor&#146;s Index Committee to include companies in leading industries and to reflect the
United States&nbsp;stock market. The NASDAQ Industry tracks the aggregate price performance of equity
securities of communications equipment companies traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market. The total
return for our stock and for each index assumes the reinvestment of dividends and is based on the
returns of the component companies weighted according to their capitalizations as of the end of
each annual period. We began paying dividends on our common stock on March&nbsp;31, 2003. Our common
stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is a component of each of the S&#038;P 500 and
the NASDAQ Industry.

telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We
derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, license fees and royalties
for use of our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related hardware sales,
software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services and services
related to delivery of multimedia content. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of
equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software
for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system
products. QCT&#146;s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices,
particularly mobile phones, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for
wireless devices include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF)&nbsp;and Power Management
(PM)&nbsp;devices. These integrated circuits for wireless devices and system software perform voice and
data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and
baseband signals and power management. QCT&#146;s system software enables the other device components to
interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling phone
manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. The
infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband CDMA
modem functionality in the wireless operator&#146;s base station equipment. QCT revenues comprised 60%,
59% and 58% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate
foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made.
Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test
manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing
and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also
responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our
integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase
our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully
assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we
purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party
manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing
business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD,
GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives license fees as well as
ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our
intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing
royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed
products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT,
etc.), and/or based on a fixed per unit amount. QTL revenues comprised 33%, 31% and 33% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The vast majority of such
revenues have been generated through our licensees&#146; sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS),
Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV)&nbsp;and Firethorn, generates revenues primarily through mobile
communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and
delivery of wireless applications. QES sells equipment, software and services used by
transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets, products and workforce.
QES also sells products that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite-based
telecommunications system and provides related services. Through September&nbsp;2008, QES has shipped
approximately 1,302,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based communications systems. QIS provides
BREW-based (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products that include user interface and
content delivery and management products and services for the wireless industry. QIS also provides
QChat, which enables virtually instantaneous push-to-talk functionality on CDMA-based wireless
devices. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise involving
wireless communications technologies to United States government agencies. Firethorn builds and
manages software applications that enable financial institutions and wireless operators to offer
mobile commerce services. QWI revenues comprised 7%, 9% and 10% of total consolidated revenues in
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSI manages the Company&#146;s strategic investment activities, including MediaFLO USA, Inc.
(MediaFLO USA), the Company&#146;s wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI also makes
strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and services. Our
strategy is to invest in CDMA-based operators, licensed device manufacturers and early-stage
companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction
of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology. Our MediaFLO USA
subsidiary offers its service over our nationwide multicasting network based on our MediaFLO Media
Distribution System (MDS)&nbsp;and FLO technology. This network is utilized as a shared resource for
wireless operators and their customers in the United States. The commercial availability of the
MediaFLO USA service to retail wireless consumers continues to be determined by our wireless
operator partners. MediaFLO USA&#146;s network uses the 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide.
Additionally, MediaFLO USA has and will continue to procure, aggregate and distribute content in
service packages which we will make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator
customers (regardless of whether they operate CDMA or GSM/WCDMA networks) in the United States.
Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships remain functions that are provided
primarily by our wireless operator partners. As part of our strategic investment activities, we
intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future, which may include
distribution of our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a spin-off
transaction.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from customers in South Korea, China, Japan and the United States comprised 35%, 21%,
14% and 9%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2008, as compared to 31%, 21%,
17% and 13%, respectively, for fiscal 2007, and 32%, 17%, 21% and 13%, respectively, for fiscal
2006. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to
which our products, software or services are delivered and, for QTL&#146;s licensing and royalty
revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. The increase in revenues from customers in South
Korea from 32% and 31% of total revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2007, respectively, to 35% in fiscal
2008 is primarily attributable to increased shipments of integrated circuits to CDMA device
manufacturers with locations in South Korea and royalty revenues from customers in South Korea.
Combined revenues from customers in Japan and the United States decreased as a percentage of total
revenues, from 34% in fiscal 2006 to 30% in fiscal 2007 and 23% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to
the increased activity by manufacturers with locations in South Korea.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources
are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based payments, income taxes and
litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various
other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as
to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates
are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates
could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe
that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of
judgment and complexity than others.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products,
royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related
hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services
and services related to delivery of multimedia content. The timing of revenue recognition and the
amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the
specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations.
Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that
we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions
to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other
volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are estimates, based on a number of
factors, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and
the contractual provisions of our customer agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties
based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License
fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee, typically five to fifteen
years. We earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that
the licensees&#146; sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales
in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. We recognize royalty revenues
based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition
criteria are met. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal
disputes, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. </I></B>Our business acquisitions typically result in
the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may
become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in
other types of transactions. As of September&nbsp;28, 2008, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of
accumulated amortization, were $1.5&nbsp;billion and $3.1&nbsp;billion, respectively. The determination of
the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business
combination or received in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets
received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if
more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, except when neither the values
of the assets received or the assets transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within
reasonable limits. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or
cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair
value can be affected by many assumptions which require significant
judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires
assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to
estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share
forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and
discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may
differ materially from that determined by others who use different
assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may
arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could
result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could
have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We assess potential impairments to intangible assets
when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset or asset group may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment
indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance
of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties
in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future
cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal
planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required
to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets.
Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact
such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that
impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our
acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly
volatile. We also hold investments in other marketable securities, including non-investment grade
debt securities, equity and debt mutual and exchange traded funds, corporate bonds and notes,
auction rate securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These investments, which are
recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders&#146; equity
as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $9.4&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;28, 2008. We record
impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has
experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than
temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our
strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to
significant market volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments,
thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary
decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in
value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been
below its original cost, the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default
or recovery rates of securities in an asset class, negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a
need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others, the performance and
pricing of the investee&#146;s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the
industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the
financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial
difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we may record
an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded $502&nbsp;million, $16&nbsp;million and $20&nbsp;million, respectively, in
other-than-temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Share-Based Payments. </I></B>We grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and
directors under our equity compensation plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our
common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each
six-month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans. The benefits provided under
these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of revised Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (FAS 123R), &#147;Share-Based Payment.&#148; We use the fair value method to
apply the provisions of FAS 123R. Share-based compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $543&nbsp;million, $493&nbsp;million and $495&nbsp;million, respectively. At
September&nbsp;28, 2008, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non-vested stock
options granted prior to that date was $1.6&nbsp;billion, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 3.5&nbsp;years. Net stock options, after forfeitures and cancellations,
granted during fiscal 2008 represented 2.7% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal
period. Total stock options granted during fiscal 2008 represented 3.2% of outstanding shares as of
the end of the fiscal period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial
option-pricing model (binomial model). The determination of the fair value of share-based payment
awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but
are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
We believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved
when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation under FAS 123R.
Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no
vesting or hedging restrictions, are fully transferable and do not cause dilution. Because our
share-based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded
options, and because valuation model assumptions are subjective, in our opinion, existing valuation
models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures
of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards. There is not currently a generally
accepted market-based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and
accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models. Although we estimate the fair value
of employee share-based awards in accordance with FAS 123R and the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107 (SAB 107), the option-pricing model we use may not
produce a value that is indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller
market transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008, we used
the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption
input to the binomial model. We utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two
years, and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the
expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years. The weighted-average volatility
assumption was 41.1% for fiscal 2008, which if increased to 45%, would increase the
weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008 by $0.89 per
share, or 5%. FAS 123R includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered
in estimating expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more useful than historical
volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical
volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for
a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant. The
weighted-average risk-free interest rate assumption was 3.8% for fiscal 2008, which if increased to
6.5% would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during
fiscal 2008 by $1.17 per share, or 7%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments, but we are
required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield
assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield
assumption was 1.3% for fiscal 2008, which if decreased to 0.4% would increase the weighted-average
estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008 by $0.92 per share, or 6%.
Dividends and/or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to approval by our Board
of Directors as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance,
stock repurchase programs, mergers and acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our
historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial
change, and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash
distributions that will be made to investors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>On October&nbsp;1, 2007, we adopted the accounting provisions of FASB Interpretation
No.&nbsp;48 (FIN 48), &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.&#148; As a result of the adoption, we
increased our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by $2&nbsp;million and accounted for the
cumulative effect of this change as a decrease to retained earnings. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note 5 &#150; Income Taxes&#148; for additional information. As of September&nbsp;28, 2008,
our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits was $227&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation
of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain
tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to
evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the
tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.
While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we
regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the
current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We
continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax
provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give
rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting
our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those which are
reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. For example,
during fiscal 2007, we recorded an income tax benefit of $331&nbsp;million resulting from the completion
of audits of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal tax returns.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation
allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing
of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning
strategies. As of September&nbsp;28, 2008, gross deferred tax assets were $1.4&nbsp;billion. If we are unable
to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a
material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable
or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on
operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;28, 2008, we had gross deferred tax assets of $430&nbsp;million related to capital
losses and $21&nbsp;million related to foreign and state net operating losses. We can only use realized
capital losses to offset realized capital gains. Based upon our assessments of when capital gains and losses will be realized, we
estimate that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all of the temporary and
other-than-temporary capital losses that were recorded through fiscal 2008. Therefore, we have
provided a $134&nbsp;million valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to
utilize, of which $81&nbsp;million was recorded as an increase in other comprehensive loss in fiscal
2008. We can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in
certain tax jurisdictions. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses
and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the
entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we
have incurred through fiscal 2008. Therefore, we have provided a $15&nbsp;million valuation allowance
for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount
of future capital gains, the timing of realization of capital losses and the amount of future
taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to
our forecast of capital losses, capital gains and taxable income are reflected in the period the
change is made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be invested
indefinitely outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will
be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for United States
federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $6.8&nbsp;billion as
of September&nbsp;28, 2008. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income
tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is
made.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to
stockholders&#146; equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for
net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits. A windfall tax benefit
occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee&#146;s disposition of a share-based
award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that we had recorded. When
assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has been realized, we follow
the tax law ordering method, under which current year share-based compensation deductions are
assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Litigation. </I></B>We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no
assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse
effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without
merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to
pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate
of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range
of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability
related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential
liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Other than amounts relating
to the <I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated </I>matters, we have not recorded any accrual for
contingent liabilities associated with any other legal proceedings based on our belief that
additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss
cannot be estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could
materially impact our results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenues. </I></B>Total revenues for fiscal 2008 were $11.14&nbsp;billion, compared to $8.87&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2007. Revenues from two customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments (each of whom accounted
for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 30% and 27%
in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2008 were $7.16&nbsp;billion, compared to
$5.77&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007. Revenues from sales of integrated circuit products increased $1.41
billion, resulting primarily from an increase of $1.23&nbsp;billion related to higher unit shipments,
mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, and an increase of $219
million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such
products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2008 were $3.98&nbsp;billion, compared to $3.11
billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related
to an increase in sales of CDMA-based products reported by QTL&#146;s licensees other than Nokia, driven by the continued adoption
of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In
addition, revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560&nbsp;million (attributable
to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) related to the new agreements with Nokia. Revenues from licensing and
royalties in fiscal 2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for sales of Nokia products
through April&nbsp;9, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2008 was
$3.41&nbsp;billion compared to $2.68&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues as
a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 48% for fiscal 2008, compared to 47% for fiscal
2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $39&nbsp;million in share-based compensation in
both fiscal 2008 and 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2008, research and development expenses were
$2.28&nbsp;billion or 20% of revenues, compared to $1.83&nbsp;billion or 21% of revenues for fiscal 2007. The
dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $358&nbsp;million increase in costs related to the
development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the
expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration
of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of
wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode,
multinetwork products and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. The
technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO
Revision B, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA&#043; and OFDMA. Research and development expenses related to the
development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS, IMOD display products using MEMS technology, BREW
products and mobile commerce applications increased by $63&nbsp;million. Research and development
expenses in fiscal 2008 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development
of $250&nbsp;million and $14&nbsp;million, respectively, compared to $221&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million,
respectively, in fiscal 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in interest and dividend income on cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities held by corporate and other segments was primarily a result of lower interest rates
earned on interest-bearing securities. Other-than-temporary losses in fiscal 2008 included $327
million recognized in the fourth quarter on marketable securities held by corporate and other
segments. Both other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and the decrease in net
realized gains on corporate investments were generally related to depressed securities values
caused by a major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial markets affecting consumers
and the banking, finance
and housing industries. This disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in
financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and
equity securities.

million for fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate was 17% for fiscal 2008, compared to 9% for
fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is higher than the annual effective tax
rate for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the impact of prior year audits completed during fiscal 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is 18% lower than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 22% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, and 1% related to research and development tax credits,
partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4% and 1% related to an increase in the valuation
allowance.

million, resulting primarily from an increase of $761&nbsp;million related to higher unit shipments,
mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, and an increase of $144

billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees increased primarily as a result
of a $306&nbsp;million increase in QTL royalties related to an increase in our licensee&#146;s sales of
CDMA-based products driven by the continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than
CDMA, and a $30&nbsp;million increase in QIS revenues primarily related to our expanded BREW customer

$1.83&nbsp;billion or 21% of revenues, compared to $1.54&nbsp;billion or 20% of revenues for fiscal 2006. The
dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $283&nbsp;million increase in costs related to
integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our
intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced
wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with
consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products
and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting
these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA,
HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA. The increase in research and development expenses incurred also related to
the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and IMOD display products using MEMS
technology. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2007 included share-based compensation and
in-process research and development of $221&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million, respectively, compared to $216

million increase in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, a $98&nbsp;million increase in
employee related expenses, a $40&nbsp;million increase in other professional fees, a $39&nbsp;million
increase in bad debt expense, a $32&nbsp;million increase in cooperative and other marketing expenses
and a $28&nbsp;million increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $44&nbsp;million gain

for each reporting segment. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#150; Note 9 &#150; Segment
Information.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QCT Segment. </I></B>QCT revenues for fiscal 2008 were $6.72&nbsp;billion, compared to $5.28&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2007. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM
integrated circuits, were $6.53&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2008, compared to $5.12&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007.
The increase in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from an increase of $1.23
billion related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $219&nbsp;million related to the net effects
of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 336&nbsp;million
MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 253&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2008 were $1.83&nbsp;billion, compared to $1.55&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2007. QCT&#146;s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage)
was 27% in fiscal 2008, compared to 29% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating margin percentage
was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin percentage related to an increase in reserves for
excess and obsolete inventory and product support costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT inventories increased by 17% in fiscal 2008 from $387&nbsp;million to $453&nbsp;million primarily
due to the shift in our manufacturing business model from turnkey to IFM and the related work-in
process which includes purchased die and related back-end assembly and test manufacturing services
needed to complete QCT&#146;s integrated circuit products. The increase is also attributable to an
increase in finished goods associated with growth in sales volume.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QTL Segment. </I></B>QTL revenues for fiscal 2008 were $3.62&nbsp;billion, compared to $2.77&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2007. QTL&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2008 were $3.14&nbsp;billion, compared to $2.34
billion for fiscal 2007. QTL&#146;s operating margin percentage was 87% in fiscal 2008, compared to 84%
in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an
increase in sales of CDMA-based products reported by QTL&#146;s
licensees other than Nokia, driven by the continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average
selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, QTL revenues
from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560&nbsp;million (attributable to both fiscal 2008
and 2007) related to the new agreement with Nokia. Revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal
2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for sales of Nokia products through April&nbsp;9, 2007.
The increase in earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and
the effect of bad debt expenses recognized in fiscal 2007, partially offset by increases in
research and development expenses and patent costs, which resulted in a corresponding increase in
operating margin percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QWI Segment. </I></B>QWI revenues for fiscal 2008 were $785&nbsp;million, compared to $828&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2007. Revenues decreased primarily due to a $78&nbsp;million decrease in QES revenues, partially
offset by a $27&nbsp;million increase in QIS revenues. The decrease in QES revenues was primarily
attributable to an $88&nbsp;million decrease in revenues from product sales, partially offset by an $11
million increase in messaging revenues. QES shipped approximately 91,200 terrestrial-based and
satellite-based systems during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 190,300 terrestrial-based and
satellite-based systems in fiscal 2007. The increase in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to
increases in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under a licensing
agreement with Sprint and our expanded BREW customer base and products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI&#146;s loss before taxes for fiscal 2008 was $1&nbsp;million, compared to earnings before taxes of
$88&nbsp;million for fiscal 2007. QWI&#146;s operating margin percentage was zero percent in fiscal 2008,
compared to 11% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes was primarily due to
the decrease in revenues, a $30&nbsp;million increase in QIS research and development expenses related
to our BREW products and a $34&nbsp;million increase in operating expenses as a result of the
acquisition of Firethorn during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, all of which contributed to a
corresponding decline in operating margin percentage.

for fiscal 2008 was $304&nbsp;million, compared to $240&nbsp;million for fiscal 2007. QSI&#146;s loss before taxes
also included a $71&nbsp;million increase in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary&#146;s loss before taxes comprised
primarily of an increase of $50&nbsp;million in cost of equipment and services revenues and a $22
million increase in research and development expenses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal&nbsp;2006</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2007 and 2006
for each reporting segment. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 &#150; Segment
Information.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QCT Segment. </I></B>QCT revenues for fiscal 2007 were $5.28&nbsp;billion, compared to $4.33&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2006. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM
integrated circuits, were $5.12&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $4.20&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2006.
The increase in equipment and services revenue resulted primarily from an increase of $761&nbsp;million
related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $144&nbsp;million related to the net effects of
changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 253&nbsp;million MSM
integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 207&nbsp;million for fiscal
2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $1.55&nbsp;billion, compared to $1.30&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2006. QCT&#146;s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage)
was 29% in fiscal 2007, compared to 30% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating margin percentage
was primarily due to increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative
expenses, partially offset by an increase in the gross margin percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT inventories increased by 116% in fiscal 2007 from $179&nbsp;million to $387&nbsp;million due to
increased purchases of completed die directly from foundry suppliers for use in QCT&#146;s CDMA-based
integrated circuit products in connection with the shift in our manufacturing business model from
turnkey to IFM.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QTL Segment. </I></B>QTL revenues for fiscal 2007 were $2.77&nbsp;billion, compared to $2.47&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2006. QTL&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $2.34&nbsp;billion, compared to $2.23
billion for fiscal 2006. QTL&#146;s operating margin percentage was 84% in fiscal 2007, compared to 90%
in fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues primarily resulted from a $306&nbsp;million increase in
royalties, driven by an increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees. The increase in
earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues, partially offset by
increases in legal and bad debt expenses, which resulted in a corresponding decline in operating
margin percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QWI Segment. </I></B>QWI revenues for fiscal 2007 were $828&nbsp;million, compared to $731&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2006. Revenues increased primarily due to increases of $78&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million in QIS
and QES revenues, respectively. The increase in QIS revenues is primarily attributable to a $61&nbsp;million increase
in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under a licensing agreement with
Sprint and an $18&nbsp;million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products.
The increase in QES revenues is primarily attributable to a $26&nbsp;million increase in equipment and
messaging revenues, partially offset by a $15&nbsp;million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues
related to historical equipment sales. QES shipped approximately 190,300 terrestrial-based and
satellite-based systems during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 140,300 terrestrial-based and
satellite-based systems in fiscal 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $88&nbsp;million, compared to $78&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2006. QWI&#146;s operating margin percentage was 11% in fiscal 2007, compared to 10% in fiscal
2006. The increase in QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $54&nbsp;million increase in
QIS gross margin, largely resulting from our expanded BREW customer base and products and QChat
development efforts, partially offset by a $29&nbsp;million increase in QWI selling, general and
administrative expenses and an $18&nbsp;million decrease in QES gross margin. The increase in QWI&#146;s
operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increase in QIS gross margin,
partially offset by the decrease in QES gross margin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QSI Segment. </I></B>QSI&#146;s loss before taxes for fiscal 2007 was $240&nbsp;million, compared to $133
million for fiscal 2006. QSI&#146;s loss before taxes included a $118&nbsp;million increase in our MediaFLO
USA subsidiary&#146;s loss before taxes comprised primarily of $70&nbsp;million in cost of services revenues
related to the commencement of our MediaFLO service in March&nbsp;2007 and a $42&nbsp;million increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses, including $20&nbsp;million related to cooperative
marketing expenses. During fiscal 2006, QSI recorded $30&nbsp;million in equity in losses of investees
resulting primarily from the effect of investment losses recognized by Inquam and a venture fund
investee in fiscal 2006, of which our share was $20&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million, respectively. Equity
in losses of investees was negligible during fiscal 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our
stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
were $11.3&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;28, 2008, a decrease of $546&nbsp;million from September&nbsp;30, 2007. Our
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September&nbsp;28, 2008 consisted of $6.8&nbsp;billion
held by foreign subsidiaries with the remaining balance of $4.5&nbsp;billion held domestically. Due to
tax considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and
investments held domestically. Total cash provided by operating activities was $3.6&nbsp;billion during
fiscal 2008, compared to $3.8&nbsp;billion during fiscal 2007. Net proceeds from the issuance of common
stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans was $1.2&nbsp;billion during fiscal 2008,
compared to $556&nbsp;million during fiscal 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;11, 2008, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $2.0&nbsp;billion
of our common stock. The $2.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program replaced a $3.0&nbsp;billion stock
repurchase program, of which approximately $2&nbsp;million remained authorized for repurchases. The
stock repurchase program has no expiration date. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased and retired
42,616,000 shares of our common stock for $1.7&nbsp;billion. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, we had not
repurchased any of our shares under the $2.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We declared and paid dividends totaling $982&nbsp;million, $862&nbsp;million and $698&nbsp;million, or $0.60,
$0.52 and $0.42 per common share, during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On October&nbsp;22,
2008, we announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share on our common stock, payable on January&nbsp;7,
2009 to stockholders of record as of December&nbsp;11, 2008. We intend to continue to pay quarterly
dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in
the best interest of our stockholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September&nbsp;2007, there has been a major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and
financial markets affecting consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This
disruption was evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline
in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities. At September&nbsp;28, 2008 and
October&nbsp;31, 2008, gross unrealized gains on marketable securities were $102&nbsp;million and
approximately $75&nbsp;million, respectively, and gross unrealized losses were $449&nbsp;million and
approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion, respectively. Our analyses of the severity and duration of price
declines, market research, industry reports, economic forecasts and the specific circumstances of
issuers indicate that it is reasonable to expect marketable securities with unrealized losses to
recover within a reasonable period of time.
Further, we have the ability and the intent to hold such securities until they recover. As a
result, we do not believe the decline in the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio will
materially affect our liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;28, 2008, we classified our auction rate securities with recorded values of $186
million as noncurrent assets due to a disruption in credit markets that caused the auction
mechanism to fail to set market-clearing rates and provide liquidity for sellers. However, a failed
auction does not represent a default by the issuer of the underlying security. Our auction rate
securities are predominantly rated AAA/Aaa, are collateralized by student loans substantially
guaranteed by the U.S. government and continue to pay interest in accordance with their contractual
terms. The cash values of our auction rate securities, which are held by a foreign subsidiary, may
not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction
process, the securities are called by the issuer or the underlying securities have been prepaid or
have matured. Due to the combined strength of our significant cash, short-term investments and
operating cash flows, we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of auction rate securities to
affect our operating plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable increased greater than 100% during fiscal 2008 primarily due to a $2.5
billion trade receivable for which we received payment in October&nbsp;2008 related to the new
agreements with Nokia, an increase of $423&nbsp;million in other trade accounts receivable and an
increase of $400&nbsp;million related to amounts receivable for redemptions of money market funds for
which we received partial payment in October&nbsp;2008. Days sales outstanding related to other trade
accounts receivable were 30&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;28, 2008 compared to 27&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;30, 2007.
The increase in other trade accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were
primarily due to increased revenues for integrated circuits and the timing of cash receipts for
related receivables.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash
flow generated from operations will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other
capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans. Our
total research and development expenditures were $2.28&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2008 and $1.83&nbsp;billion in
fiscal 2007, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new
technologies, applications and services for the wireless industry. Our purchase obligations for
fiscal 2009, some of which relate to research and development activities, totaled $868&nbsp;million, at
September&nbsp;28, 2008. Cash used for strategic investments and acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was
$298&nbsp;million in fiscal 2008 and $249&nbsp;million in fiscal 2007, and we expect to continue making
strategic investments and acquisitions to open new markets for our technology, expand our
technology, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business
opportunities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;157 (FAS 157), &#147;Fair Value Measurements,&#148;
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements. FAS 157 does not
require any new fair value measurements, but applies to other accounting pronouncements that
require or permit fair value measurements. In February&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
157-2 (FSP 157-2) which delays the effective date of FAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis, until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-3 (FSP 157-3) which clarifies the
application of FAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key
considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that
financial asset is not active. The accounting provisions of FAS 157 for financial assets and
financial liabilities will be effective for our fiscal 2009 beginning September&nbsp;29, 2008. The
adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are in the process of determining
the effect such adoption will have on our financial statement disclosures. We are also in the
process of assessing the effects, if any, the adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities will have on our consolidated financial statements.

which provides companies the irrevocable option to measure many financial assets and liabilities at

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Credit Risk. </I></B>Since September&nbsp;2007, there has been a major disruption in U.S. and foreign
credit and financial markets affecting consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries.
This disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe
decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities. The result has
been depressed security values and widening credit spreads in most types of investment- and
non-investment-grade bonds and debt obligations and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. We have
no direct investments in the lowest credit quality, or subprime, mortgages, nor do we have
investments collateralized by assets that include subprime mortgages. We have indirect exposure to
subprime mortgages to the extent of our investments in large, diversified financial companies,
commercial banks, insurance companies and public/private investment funds that participate or
invest in subprime mortgage loans, mortgage insurance or loan servicing, which could impact the
fair values of our securities. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, we held a significant portion of our
corporate cash in diversified portfolios of fixed- and floating-rate, investment-grade marketable
securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, non-investment-grade bank loans and bonds,
preferred stocks, equities and other securities that have been affected by these credit market
concerns and had temporary gross unrealized losses of $449&nbsp;million. At October&nbsp;31, 2008, gross
unrealized losses of our marketable securities portfolio were
approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion. Although
we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur
other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these and other
similarly affected securities if U.S. credit and equity markets do not stabilize and recover to
previous levels in the coming quarters.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We engage in transactions in which certain fixed-income and equity securities are loaned to
selected broker-dealers. We may incur a loss in the event that a broker does not return our
securities, the collateral value is insufficient or cannot be maintained at required values or the
lending agent fails to restore or pay us the cash value of our loaned securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest Rate Risk. </I></B>We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment- and
non-investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable
debt securities and debt mutual funds. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates
can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates
in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing
securities could lose value. When the general economy weakens significantly, as it has recently,
the credit profile, financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest-bearing
securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities
may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily. We may implement investment strategies
of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Equity Price Risk. </I></B>The recent major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial
markets caused increased volatility in the fair values of our equity securities and equity mutual
and exchange-traded fund shares. We have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that
includes equities held by mutual and exchange-traded fund shares that are subject to equity price
risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities decreased to $1.34&nbsp;billion at September
28, 2008 from $1.52&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2007. The recorded values of equity mutual fund and
exchange-traded fund shares decreased to $1.28&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;28, 2008 from $1.87&nbsp;billion at
September&nbsp;30, 2007. The combined recorded values of marketable equity securities and equity mutual
and exchange-traded fund shares decreased by approximately $725&nbsp;million due to price declines and
by approximately $48&nbsp;million as a result of actions taken to reduce our exposure to equity
investments. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size,
style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price
volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity
securities and equity mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares at September&nbsp;28, 2008 would cause
a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these
securities, or $262&nbsp;million. At October&nbsp;31, 2008, gross
unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity
mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares were approximately
$786&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Foreign Exchange Risk. </I></B>We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign
currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. Such derivative financial
instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or
trading purposes. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding.
At September&nbsp;28, 2008, we had a net asset of $37&nbsp;million related to our foreign currency option
contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international
licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products. In the event of the financial insolvency or
distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle
transactions, which could materially impact our results. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to
decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged
foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $8&nbsp;million resulting from a decrease in
fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See &#147;Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 &#150; The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies&#148;
for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the
functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may
affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and
liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency
transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign
currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments.
While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency
values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our
products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.

financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of
human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated
and its subsidiaries at September&nbsp;28, 2008 and September&nbsp;30, 2007 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September&nbsp;28, 2008
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September&nbsp;28, 2008, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note&nbsp;1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective October&nbsp;1, 2007,
the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>The Company. </I></B>QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM), a Delaware corporation,
develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and
services. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA)-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications,
multimedia functions and global positioning system products to wireless device and infrastructure
manufacturers. The Company also manufactures and sells products based upon Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA)&nbsp;technology, e.g. FLASH-OFDM. The Company grants licenses to
use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential
to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, and receives license
fees as well as ongoing royalties based on sales by licensees of wireless telecommunications
equipment products incorporating its patented technologies. Currently, the vast majority of the
Company&#146;s license fees and royalty revenues is comprised of fees and royalties from companies
selling wireless products incorporating the Company&#146;s CDMA technologies, but the Company has also
licensed its patented OFDMA technology. The Company provides satellite- and terrestrial-based
two-way data messaging and position reporting services for transportation companies, private
fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. The Company provides the BREW
(Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) product and services to wireless network operators,
device manufacturers and application developers and support for developing and delivering
over-the-air wireless applications and services. The Company also makes strategic investments to
promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and internet data
communications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Principles of Consolidation. </I></B>The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the
assets, liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries. The ownership of the
other interest holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest and is not
significant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees are included in the consolidated
financial statements one month in arrears to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in
the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not have any investments in
entities it believes are variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary
beneficiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Financial Statement Preparation. </I></B>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Fiscal Year. </I></B>The Company operates and reports using a 52-53&nbsp;week fiscal year ending on the
last Sunday in September. The fiscal years ended September&nbsp;28, 2008 and September&nbsp;24, 2006 each
included 52&nbsp;weeks. The fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2007 included 53&nbsp;weeks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>The Company derives revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit
products, royalties and license fees for its intellectual property, messaging and other services
and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software
hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. The timing of revenue
recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of
factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of the Company&#146;s
deliverables and obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company allocates revenue for transactions that include multiple elements to each unit of
accounting based on its relative fair value and recognizes revenue for each unit of accounting when
revenue recognition criteria have been met. The price charged when the element is sold separately
generally determines fair value. When the Company has objective evidence of the fair values of
undelivered elements but not delivered elements, the Company allocates revenue first to the fair
value of the undelivered elements, and the residual revenue is then allocated to the delivered
elements. If the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement
cannot
be objectively determined, revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered or services
have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining
undelivered elements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of the Company&#146;s products are recognized at the time of shipment, or when
title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if
later. Revenues from providing services, including software hosting services and the delivery of
multimedia content, are recognized when earned.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company licenses rights to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain
wireless products. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing
royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using the Company&#146;s licensed
intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the
licensee, typically five to fifteen years. The Company earns royalties on such licensed products
sold worldwide by its licensees at the time that the licensees&#146; sales occur. The Company&#146;s
licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after
the conclusion of that quarter. The Company recognizes royalty revenues based on royalties reported
by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from long-term contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The
percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs. Revenues
and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit
estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the
revision become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of contract
profit would be required. Estimated contract losses are recognized when determined
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides both perpetual and renewable time-based software licenses. Revenues from
software license fees are recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met and, if applicable,
when vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of
multiple-element software arrangements, including post-contract customer support. Post-contract
support is recognized ratably over the term of the related contract. When contracts contain
multiple elements wherein the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support and
vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of post-contract customer support does not
exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. The
amount or timing of the Company&#146;s software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in
these judgments or estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special
pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are based
on a number of factors, including the contractual provisions of the customer agreements and the
Company&#146;s assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes, market share and
inventory levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unearned revenues consist primarily of fees related to software products, license fees for
intellectual property, hardware product sales with continuing performance obligations and billings
on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Concentrations. </I></B>A significant portion of the Company&#146;s revenues is concentrated with a limited
number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless telecommunications products is dominated
by a small number of large corporations. Revenues from two customers of the Company&#146;s QCT, QTL and
QWI segments each comprised an aggregate of 16% and 14% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal
2008, compared to 13% and 14% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 13% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006, respectively. Aggregated accounts receivable from these two
customers and from Nokia Corporation/Nokia Inc. (Nokia) (Notes 3 and 8) comprised 73% and 40% of
gross accounts receivable at September&nbsp;28, 2008 and September&nbsp;30, 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from international customers were approximately 91% of total consolidated revenues in
fiscal 2008 and 87% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services Revenues. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues is primarily
comprised of the cost of equipment revenues, the cost of messaging and multimedia content delivery
services revenues and the cost of development and other services revenues. Cost of equipment
revenues consists of the cost of equipment sold, the amortization of certain intangible assets,
including license fees and patents, and sustaining engineering costs,
including personnel and related costs. Cost of messaging and multimedia content delivery
services revenues consists principally of satellite transponder costs, network operations expenses,
including personnel and related costs, depreciation, content costs and airtime charges by
telecommunications operators. Cost of development and other services revenues primarily includes
personnel costs and related expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Shipping and Handling Costs. </I></B>Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of
equipment and services revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a
customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development. </I></B>Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed
as incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after technological feasibility
of the software is established.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Marketing. </I></B>Certain cooperative marketing programs reimburse customers for marketing activities
for certain of the Company&#146;s products and services, subject to defined criteria. Cooperative
marketing obligations are accrued and the costs are recorded in the period in which the costs are
incurred by the customer and the Company is obligated to reimburse the customer. Cooperative
marketing costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent that a
marketing benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the cash paid does
not exceed the fair value of that marketing benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the fair
value of the marketing benefit received is recorded as a reduction in revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in
income in the period such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
October&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48
(FIN 48), &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,&#148; which prescribes a comprehensive model for the
financial statement recognition, measurement, classification and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions. As a result of the adoption, the Company increased its liabilities related to uncertain
tax positions by $2&nbsp;million and accounted for the cumulative effect of this change as a decrease to
retained earnings. The Company historically classified such liabilities as reductions to deferred
tax assets or as current income taxes payable. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified $174&nbsp;million
in unrecognized tax benefits for which the Company does not anticipate payment or receipt of cash
within one year to noncurrent income taxes payable. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits as of the date of adoption of FIN 48 was $224&nbsp;million, of which $159&nbsp;million would affect
the effective tax rate if recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s policy of including interest and penalties related to income taxes, including
unrecognized tax benefits, within the provision for income taxes did not change as a result of
implementing FIN 48. As of the date of adoption, the amounts recognized in income tax expense and
income taxes payable for interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits were
negligible.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation
of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain
tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to
evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the
tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.
While the Company believes it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns,
the Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in
determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company continually assesses the likelihood
and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax
provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that
give rise to a revision become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options
directly to stockholders&#146; equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not
recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits. A windfall
tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the Company upon an employee&#146;s
disposition of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the
award that the Company had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based
compensation has been realized, the Company follows the tax law ordering method, under which
current year share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating
loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cash Equivalents. </I></B>The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and government agencies&#146; securities. The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Marketable Securities. </I></B>The appropriate classification of marketable securities is determined
at the time of purchase, and such designation is reevaluated as of each balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value as determined by the most recently traded
price of each security at the balance sheet date. For securities that may not have been actively
traded in a given period, fair value is determined using matrix pricing and other valuation
techniques. The net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The specific identification method is
used to compute the realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its marketable
securities. When assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the
Company considers factors including: how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the
original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost,
the underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset
class, the performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in relation to the stock price of its
competitors within the industry, expected market volatility and the market in general, analyst
recommendations, the views of external investment managers, any news or financial information that
has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the
investee operates. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets
has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a charge to investment income
(expense).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Allowances for Doubtful Accounts. </I></B>The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company&#146;s customers to make required payments.
The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably
assured: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic
industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience
with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from various credit organizations to
ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors. The Company may also request
financial information, including financial statements or other documents (e.g. bank statements) to
ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate
collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured,
which is generally upon receipt of cash. If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers were
to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Inventories. </I></B>Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost, not to
exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventory is
assessed based on review of committed purchase orders from customers, as well as purchase
commitment projections provided by customers, among other things.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Property, Plant and Equipment. </I></B>Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over 30&nbsp;years and 15&nbsp;years, respectively.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging
from 2 to 15&nbsp;years. Direct external and internal costs of developing software for internal use are
capitalized subsequent to the preliminary stage of development. Leased property meeting certain
capital lease criteria is capitalized, and the net present value of the related lease payments is
recorded as a liability. Amortization
of capital leased assets is recorded using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals and betterments
are charged to expense as incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Derivatives. </I></B>The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge
certain foreign currency transactions and probable anticipated foreign currency transactions. Gains
and losses arising from changes in the fair values of foreign currency forward and option contracts
that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in investment income (expense)&nbsp;as gains
(losses)&nbsp;on derivative instruments. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign
currency forward and option contracts that are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as gains (losses)&nbsp;on derivative instruments,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. </I></B>Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and
related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain
events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The Company completed
its annual testing for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 and determined that its recorded goodwill was not
impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless
the lives are determined to be indefinite. Acquired intangible assets are carried at cost, less
accumulated amortization. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in
a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary
exchanges, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to
establish the cost bases, except when neither of the values of the assets received or the assets
transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation
techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to
measure fair value. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is computed over the useful
lives of the respective assets.

its long-lived assets or asset groups when there is evidence that events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recovered. An
impairment loss is recognized when the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum
of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
asset or asset group. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction
in the carrying value of the related asset or asset group and a charge to operating results.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods
if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of the intangible assets may be
impaired.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company uses the implied volatility of market-traded options in the Company&#146;s stock for
the expected volatility assumption. The term structure of volatility is used up to approximately
two years, and the Company used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to
maturity for periods beyond two years. The selection of implied volatility data to estimate
expected volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the Company&#146;s
stock and the Company&#146;s assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock
price trends than historical volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for
the terms of the Company&#146;s employee stock options. The Company does not target a specific dividend
yield for its dividend payments but is required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the
binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company&#146;s history and expectation of
future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future. The post-vesting
forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factor are based on the Company&#146;s historical option
cancellation and employee exercise information, respectively. The suboptimal exercise
factor is the ratio by which the stock price must increase over the exercise price before
employees are expected to exercise their stock options.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock
options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the binomial model. The
expected life of employee stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions used in
the Company&#146;s model. The binomial model assumes that employees&#146; exercise behavior is a function of
the options&#146; remaining contractual life and the extent to which the option is in-the-money (i.e.
the average stock price during the period is above the strike price of the stock option). The
binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on
the history of exercises and cancellations of past grants made by the Company. The expected life of
employee stock options granted, derived from the binomial model, was 5.9&nbsp;years, 6.2&nbsp;years and 5.8
years during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-vesting forfeiture rate represents the rate at which stock options are expected to be
forfeited by employees prior to their vesting. Pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated to be
approximately 0% in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, based on historical experience. The effect of
pre-vesting forfeitures on the Company&#146;s recorded expense has historically been negligible due to
the predominantly monthly vesting of option grants. If pre-vesting forfeitures occur in the future,
the Company will record the effect of such forfeitures as the forfeitures occur. The Company will
continue to evaluate the appropriateness of this assumption.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Earnings Per Common Share. </I></B>Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted
earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of dilutive common
share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under the Company&#146;s share-based compensation plans
and shares subject to written put options, and the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. Dilutive common share equivalents include the dilutive
effect of in-the-money share equivalents, which is calculated based on the average share price for
each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the exercise price of
an option, the amount of compensation cost, if any, for future service that the Company has not yet
recognized, and the amount of estimated tax benefits that would be recorded in paid-in capital, if
any, when the option is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current
period. The incremental dilutive common share equivalents, calculated using the treasury stock
method, for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 27,618,000, 32,333,000 and 51,835,000, respectively.

stock during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect on diluted earnings per share
would be anti-dilutive. The computation of diluted earnings per share excluded 781,000, 404,000 and
325,000 shares of common stock issuable under our employee stock purchase plans during fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, because the effect on diluted earnings per share would be
anti-dilutive. Put options outstanding during 2008 and 2007 to purchase 1,607,000 and 1,456,000
shares of common stock, respectively, were not included in the earnings per common share
computation because the put options&#146; exercise prices were less than the average market price of the
common stock while they were outstanding, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per common
share would be anti-dilutive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Future Accounting Requirements. </I></B>In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;157 (FAS
157), &#147;Fair Value Measurements,&#148; which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the
financial statements. FAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies to
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. In February&nbsp;2008,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2 (FSP 157-2) which delays the effective date of FAS 157
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until the beginning of
the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-3 (FSP
157-3) which clarifies the application of FAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an
example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when
the market for that financial asset is not active. The accounting provisions of FAS 157 for
financial assets and financial liabilities will be effective for the Company&#146;s fiscal 2009
beginning September&nbsp;29, 2008. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and financial
liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
statements, and the Company is in the process of determining the effects such adoption will have on
its financial statement disclosures. The Company is also in the process of assessing the effects,
if any, the adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have on
its consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;159 (FAS 159), &#147;The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities&#151;Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;115,&#148;
which provides companies the irrevocable option to measure many financial assets and liabilities at
fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings (the fair value option) resulting
in an opportunity to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and
liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The accounting
provisions of FAS 159 will be effective for the Company&#146;s fiscal 2009 beginning September&nbsp;29, 2008.
The Company is still in the process of determining whether it will apply the fair value option to
any of its
financial assets. If the Company does elect the fair value option, the cumulative effect of
initially adoption FAS 159 will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the
year of adoption and will be presented separately.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB revised Statement No.&nbsp;141 (FAS 141R), &#147;Business Combinations,&#148;
which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination (i)
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii)&nbsp;recognizes and measures
the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii)
determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the
nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R will be effective for the
Company&#146;s fiscal 2010 beginning September&nbsp;28, 2009. The Company is in the process of determining
the effects, if any, the adoption of FAS 141R will have on its consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;161 (FAS 161), &#147;Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133,&#148; which requires
additional disclosures about the objectives of using derivative instruments, the method by which
the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No.133
and its related interpretations, and the effect of derivative instruments and related hedged items
on financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 also requires disclosure of
the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format. FAS 161
will be effective for the Company&#146;s second quarter of fiscal 2009 beginning December&nbsp;29, 2008. The
Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption of FAS 161 will have on&nbsp;its
financial statement disclosures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketable securities in the amount of $169&nbsp;million and $411&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;28, 2008 and
September&nbsp;30, 2007, respectively, have been loaned under the Company&#146;s securities lending program.
Since March&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company classified its auction rate securities as noncurrent due to a
disruption in credit markets that caused the auction mechanism to fail to set market-clearing rates
and provide liquidity for sellers. However, a failed auction does not represent a default by the
issuer of the underlying security. The Company&#146;s auction rate securities are predominantly rated
AAA/Aaa, are collateralized by student loans substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government and
continue to pay interest in accordance with their contractual terms. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, the
recorded values of the auction rate securities were approximately 4% less than their par values.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;28, 2008, the contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt securities

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investments in marketable securities were caused
primarily by a major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial markets affecting
consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This disruption is evidenced by a
deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of
capital and demand for debt and equity securities. The result has been depressed securities values
in most types of investment- and non-investment-grade bonds and debt obligations, mortgage- and
asset-backed securities and equity securities. At October&nbsp;31, 2008, gross unrealized gains were
approximately $75&nbsp;million and gross unrealized losses were
approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion. When
assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the Company considers
factors including: how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost,
the underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset
class, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the
performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within
the industry, expected market volatility and the market in general, analyst recommendations, the
views of external investment managers, any news or financial information that has been released
specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.
The Company&#146;s analyses of the severity and duration of price declines, market research, industry
reports, economic forecasts and the specific circumstances of issuers indicate that it is
reasonable to expect marketable securities with unrealized losses to recover in fair value up to
the Company&#146;s cost bases within a reasonable period of time. Further, the Company has the ability
and the intent to hold such
securities until they recover. Accordingly, the Company considers the unrealized losses to be
temporary at September&nbsp;28, 2008.

goodwill. The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for annual impairment testing
purposes. Goodwill was allocable to reporting units included in the Company&#146;s reportable segments
at September&nbsp;28, 2008 as follows: $435&nbsp;million in Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, $683&nbsp;million in
Qualcomm Technology Licensing, $265&nbsp;million in Qualcomm Wireless &#038; Internet, and $134&nbsp;million in
Qualcomm MEMS Technology (a nonreportable segment included in reconciling items in Note 9). The
increase in goodwill from September&nbsp;30, 2007 to September&nbsp;28, 2008 was the result of the Company&#146;s
business acquisitions, partially offset by currency translation adjustments and tax deductions
resulting from the exercise of stock options that were vested as of the business acquisition date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in wireless licenses from September&nbsp;30, 2007 to September&nbsp;28, 2008 was primarily
the result of the Company&#146;s acquisition during the year of 700 MHz spectrum in the United States
primarily for its MediaFLO USA business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;28, 2008, technology-based intangible assets included $1.8&nbsp;billion related to the
estimated fair value of patents that were assigned to the Company by Nokia in October&nbsp;2008 pursuant
to the new license agreement with Nokia. The estimated fair value of the patents was determined, in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, using the income approach
based on projected cash flows, on a discounted basis, over the assigned patents&#146; estimated useful
life of approximately 15&nbsp;years. The estimated fair value of the patents will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over this useful life, beginning from the date the patents were assigned to the
Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the Company&#146;s intangible assets, other than certain wireless licenses in the amount of
$753&nbsp;million and goodwill, are subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to these
intangible assets for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $84&nbsp;million, $68&nbsp;million and $32&nbsp;million,
respectively, and for fiscal 2009 to 2013 is expected to be
$199&nbsp;million, $196&nbsp;million, $193&nbsp;million,
$180&nbsp;million and
$162&nbsp;million, respectively, and $1.4&nbsp;billion thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Unearned Revenues. </I></B>At September&nbsp;28, 2008, unearned revenues included $3.9&nbsp;billion related to
upfront consideration that resulted from the new agreements with Nokia. The Company will recognize
this amount over the approximate 14-year remaining term of the license agreement. As a result of
executing the agreements with Nokia, the Company recorded $560&nbsp;million (attributable to both fiscal
2008 and 2007) in licensing and royalty revenues in fiscal 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has not provided for United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a
cumulative total of approximately $6.8&nbsp;billion of undistributed earnings from certain non-United
States subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should the Company repatriate
foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period
management determined that the Company would repatriate the earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and
foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to United States federal examinations by taxing
authorities for years prior to fiscal 2005. The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting an
examination of the Company&#146;s United States income tax returns for fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007, which is
anticipated to be completed by August&nbsp;2009. The Company is subject to examination by the California
Franchise Tax Board for fiscal 2003 through 2007 and is currently under examination for fiscal 2004
and 2005. The Company is also subject to income taxes in many state and local taxing jurisdictions
in the United States and around the world, many of which are open to tax examinations for periods after
fiscal 2002.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2007, the Internal Revenue Service completed audits of the Company&#146;s tax returns
for fiscal 2003 and 2004 and during fiscal 2006, the Internal Revenue Service and the California
Franchise Tax Board completed audits of the Company&#146;s tax returns for fiscal 2001 and 2002,
resulting in adjustments to the Company&#146;s net operating loss and credit carryover amounts for those
years. The tax provision was reduced by $331&nbsp;million and $73&nbsp;million during fiscal 2007 and 2006,
respectively, to reflect the known and expected impacts of the audits on the reviewed and open tax
years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;28, 2008, the Company had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of $128
million expiring from 2019 through 2027, unused state net operating loss carryforwards of $146
million expiring from 2009 through 2028, and unused foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $49
million, with $48&nbsp;million expiring from 2011 through 2012. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, the Company had
unused federal income tax credits of $108&nbsp;million, expiring from 2022 through 2028, and state income
tax credits of $10&nbsp;million, which do not expire. The Company does not expect its federal net
operating loss carryforwards and its federal and state income tax credits to expire unused. The
Company has provided a valuation allowance on a portion of its state net operating loss
carryforwards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes, more likely than not, that it will have sufficient taxable income after
stock option related deductions to utilize the majority of its deferred tax assets. As of September
28, 2008, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on foreign and state net operating losses
and net capital losses of $15&nbsp;million and $134&nbsp;million, respectively, of which $81&nbsp;million was
recorded as an increase in other comprehensive loss in fiscal 2008. The valuation allowances
reflect the uncertainty surrounding the Company&#146;s ability to generate sufficient future taxable
income in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions to utilize its net operating losses
and the Company&#146;s ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $244&nbsp;million of unrecognized tax benefits as of September&nbsp;28, 2008, $223&nbsp;million has
been classified as noncurrent income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheet and $21
million has been classified as a reduction of the related deferred tax assets. Noncurrent income
taxes payable also includes $4&nbsp;million of accrued interest. Unrecognized tax benefits at September
28, 2008 include $201&nbsp;million for tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax
rate. The unrecognized tax benefits differ from the amount that would affect the Company&#146;s
effective tax rate primarily due to the impact of offsets in other jurisdictions. Due to the
anticipated resolution of the U.S. federal examination within the next twelve months, it is
reasonably possible that the Company&#146;s unrecognized tax benefits will decrease significantly as a
result of their resolution via an adjustment by the taxing authority or recognition in the income
tax provision. Interest expense related to uncertain tax positions was $3&nbsp;million in fiscal 2008 and was
negligible in both fiscal 2007 and 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $360&nbsp;million, $233&nbsp;million
and $172&nbsp;million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The income taxes paid are primarily
related to foreign withholding taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was enacted. The bill
extends the research and development tax credit for calendar year 2008 and 2009 and increases the
Alternative Simplified Credit rate from 12% to 14% in calendar 2009. The Company expects to record
an additional research and development tax credit related to fiscal 2008 of approximately $38
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the period in which the research and development tax
credit extension was enacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 6. Capital Stock</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Preferred Stock. </I></B>The Company has 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance
in one or more series, at a par value of $0.0001 per share. In conjunction with the distribution of
preferred share purchase rights, 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock are designated as Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock and such shares are reserved for issuance upon exercise of the
preferred share purchase rights. At September&nbsp;28, 2008 and September&nbsp;30, 2007, no shares of
preferred stock were outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Preferred Share Purchase Rights Agreement. </I></B>The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Agreement (Rights Agreement) to protect stockholders&#146; interests in the event of a proposed takeover
of the Company. Under the original Rights Agreement, adopted on September&nbsp;26, 1995, the Company
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company&#146;s
common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, as amended and restated on December&nbsp;7,
2006, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a one one-thousandth
share of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, subject to
adjustment for subsequent stock splits, at a purchase price of $180. The Rights are exercisable
only if a person or group (an Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
Company&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock without approval of the Board of Directors. Upon
exercise, holders, other than an Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to termination, to
receive the Company&#146;s common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having a market value,
as defined, equal to twice such purchase price. The Rights, which expire on September&nbsp;25, 2015, are
redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the Company&#146;s option prior to the time such Rights are
triggered for a price of $0.001 per Right.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Stock Repurchase Program. </I></B>On March&nbsp;11, 2008, the Company announced that it had been authorized
to repurchase up to $2.0&nbsp;billion of the Company&#146;s common stock. The $2.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase
program replaced a $3.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program, of which approximately $2&nbsp;million
remained authorized for repurchases. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. When
stock is repurchased and retired, the amount paid in excess of par value is recorded to paid-in
capital. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company repurchased and retired 42,616,000,
37,263,000 and 34,000,000 shares of common stock for $1.7&nbsp;billion, $1.5&nbsp;billion and $1.5&nbsp;billion,
respectively, excluding $14&nbsp;million, $9&nbsp;million and $5&nbsp;million of premiums received related to put
options that were exercised in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, the
Company had not made any repurchases under the $2.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Company&#146;s stock repurchase program, the Company sold put options on its
own stock during fiscal 2007 and 2006. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, no put options remained outstanding.
During fiscal 2008, the Company recognized gains of $6&nbsp;million in investment income due to
decreases in the fair values of put options, including premiums received of $14&nbsp;million. During
fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $3&nbsp;million and $29&nbsp;million, respectively, in
investment losses due to net increases in the fair values of put options, net of premiums received
of $17&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;22, 2008, the Company announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share on the Company&#146;s
common stock, payable on January&nbsp;7, 2009 to stockholders of record as of December&nbsp;11, 2008, which
will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 7. Employee Benefit Plans</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Employee Savings and Retirement Plan. </I></B>The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows eligible
employees to contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, subject to annual limits. The
Company matches a portion of the employee contributions and may, at its discretion, make additional
contributions based upon earnings. The Company&#146;s contribution expense for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006 was $45&nbsp;million, $39&nbsp;million and $33&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Equity Compensation Plans. </I></B>The Board of Directors may grant options to selected employees,
directors and consultants to the Company to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at a
price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The 2006 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan) was adopted during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and replaced
the 2001 Stock Option Plan and the 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan and their
predecessor plans (the Prior Plans). The 2006 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and
nonstatutory stock options as well as stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, performance units and shares and other stock-based awards and will be the source of shares
issued under the Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan
(ERMCP). The share reserve under the 2006 Plan was 405,284,000 at
September&nbsp;28, 2008, including 115,000,000 shares that were
approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders in March&nbsp;2008. Shares subject to any outstanding option under a Prior Plan that is terminated or cancelled (but
not an option under a Prior Plan that expires) following the date that the 2006 Plan was approved
by stockholders, and shares that are subject to an award under the ERMCP and are returned to the
Company because they fail to vest, will again become available for grant under the 2006 Plan. The
Board of Directors of the Company may amend or terminate the 2006 Plan at any time. Certain
amendments, including an increase in the share reserve, require stockholder approval. Generally,
options and restricted stock units outstanding vest over periods not exceeding five years. Options
are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2008 and 2006, the Company assumed a total of approximately 1,462,000 and
3,530,000 outstanding stock options, respectively, under various stock-based incentive plans that
were assumed (the Assumed Plans) as a result of acquisitions. The Assumed Plans were suspended on
the dates of acquisition, and no additional shares may be granted under those plans. The Assumed
Plans provided for the grant of both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options.
Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding five years and are exercisable for
up to ten years from the grant date.

option-pricing model is affected by the Company&#146;s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a
number of highly complex and subjective variables. At September&nbsp;28, 2008, total unrecognized
estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.6
billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5&nbsp;years. The total
intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1.3&nbsp;billion, $708

stock options of $1.1&nbsp;billion, $479&nbsp;million and $608&nbsp;million and related tax benefits of $492
million, $272&nbsp;million and $421&nbsp;million during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Upon option
exercise, the Company issues new shares of stock.

on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period. Employees may authorize the Company
to withhold up to 15% of their compensation during any offering period, subject to certain
limitations. In fiscal 2008, the Company amended the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to include a
Non-423(b) Plan. The amended 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to approximately
24,709,000 shares to be granted. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 2,951,000,
2,650,000 and 2,220,000 shares were issued under the plans at an average price of $35.96, $32.08

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Litigation. </I></B><I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On May&nbsp;18, 2005, Broadcom filed
two actions (the 467 case and the 468 case) in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California against the Company alleging infringement of ten patents and seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On the following day, Broadcom also filed a
complaint in the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)&nbsp;alleging infringement of the
five patents at issue in the 468 case seeking a determination and relief under Section&nbsp;337 of the
Tariff Act of 1930. Allegations relating to two of the Broadcom patent claims filed in the 468 case
(which is stayed pending completion of the ITC action) have been dismissed by agreement of the
parties. In the 467 case, one patent was stayed due to a pending reexamination of the claims by the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and another was dismissed by agreement of the parties. A
trial relating to the three remaining Broadcom patents in the 467 case was held in May&nbsp;2007, and on
May&nbsp;29, 2007, the jury rendered a verdict finding willful infringement of the three patents and
awarding past damages in the approximate amount of $20&nbsp;million (the court subsequently vacated the
jury&#146;s finding of willfulness). The final judgment, including damages calculations through May&nbsp;29,
2007 and pre-judgment interest, was approximately $25&nbsp;million, which has been secured by an
irrevocable letter of credit and expensed pending appeals. On December&nbsp;31, 2007, the court issued
an order, amended by the court for a second time on March&nbsp;11, 2008, enjoining the Company from
making, using, selling, shipping, supporting or marketing products that were found to infringe the
three Broadcom patents, subject to a specified limited license through January&nbsp;2009 on two of the
three patents and with respect to the third patent, a limited license as to one set of products.
The immediately enjoined products were those WCDMA products that related to patent number 6,847,686
(the &#145;686 patent). With respect to EV-DO products involving the &#145;686 patent (as well as products
relating to the two remaining patents), the judge&#146;s order provided for a permanent injunction but
stayed the effect of that injunction until January&nbsp;31, 2009 with respect to companies that
purchased those enjoined products as of May&nbsp;29, 2007. The stay was subject to certain conditions,
including the Company&#146;s payment of ongoing royalties. Since the second amendment of the injunction
order in March&nbsp;2008, Broadcom filed a motion requesting that Qualcomm be found in contempt of the
order on various bases. The court denied the motion in part but granted the motion with respect to
the claim that Qualcomm should not have paid for WCDMA chips sold between the date of trial verdict
and the injunction, and should not have serviced and supported products using such chips, and that
Qualcomm should have paid certain royalties on revenue relating to the QChat product. Since the
order, on September&nbsp;24, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal
Circuit) issued its opinion in the appeal resulting from the trial of the 467 case, upholding the
verdict and remedies as to two patents and overturning the verdict and remedy as to the &#145;686
patent, finding it invalid. As a result, the district court has issued a third amended injunction
order excluding any reference to the invalid patent and amended the contempt findings relating to
the invalidated patent. Broadcom has been ordered to repay royalties relating to that patent.
Qualcomm has also since filed a notice of appeal as to the contempt ruling and has sought leave
from the Federal Circuit for an extension of time to file a motion for a rehearing with respect to
certain issues on the appeal. That extension was granted. Broadcom has filed another motion seeking
a ruling that Qualcomm is in violation of the injunction order with respect to certain sales and
royalties Broadcom claims are owed under the order. Finally, the patent that was subject to the
stay pending reexamination in the USPTO has since emerged from the reexamination process with
certain claims cancelled and other claims added. A schedule for the litigation of that patent has
not yet been determined, but it is expected to occur in the last half of calendar 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;14, 2006, an ITC hearing also commenced as to three patents alleged by Broadcom to
be infringed by the Company. On October&nbsp;10, 2006, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&nbsp;issued an
initial determination in which he recommended against any downstream remedies and found no
infringement by the Company on two of the three remaining patents and most of the asserted claims
of the third patent. The ALJ did find infringement on some claims of one patent. The ALJ did not
recommend excluding chips accused by Broadcom but, instead, recommended a limited exclusion order
directed only to chips that are already programmed with a specific software module and recommended
a related cease and desist order. The Commission adopted the ALJ&#146;s initial determination on
violation and, on June&nbsp;7, 2007, issued a cease and desist order against the Company and an
exclusion order directed at chips programmed with specific software and certain downstream products
first imported after the date of the exclusion order. The Federal Circuit issued stays of the
exclusion order with respect to the downstream products of all of the
Company&#146;s customers that requested the stay. The Company appealed the infringement finding,
the cease and desist order and the exclusion order, and Broadcom appealed certain rulings of the
ALJ. Oral arguments took place on July&nbsp;8, 2008 in the Federal Circuit. On September&nbsp;19, 2008, the
Federal Circuit ruled on Broadcom&#146;s appeal of the ITC&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">determination of no violation as to two
patents (the &#145;311 patent and the &#145;675 patent). The Federal Circuit affirmed the ITC&#146;s determination
as to the &#145;311 patent and affirmed the findings on the &#145;675 patent with respect to seven of eight
products at issue. As to the latter patent, the court remanded for further proceedings the claims
with respect to one accused product. On October&nbsp;2, 2008, the USPTO issued a final office action in
the reexamination of the &#145;311 patent, rejecting certain of the claims, including all of the claims
at issue in the ITC action, and allowing other claims added by Broadcom. On November&nbsp;9, 2007,
Broadcom filed an enforcement complaint in the ITC, alleging violations of the ITC&#146;s cease and
desist order by the Company. A hearing on the complaint took place on April&nbsp;22 through April&nbsp;24,
2008. The target date for completion of the investigation is August&nbsp;30, 2009. On October&nbsp;14, 2008,
the Federal Circuit issued an opinion upholding the ITC&#146;s finding that the Company did not directly
infringe the &#145;983 patent; vacating and remanding the ITC&#146;s finding that the Company indirectly
induced infringement of the &#145;983 patent; and vacating and remanding the limited exclusion order.
The Federal Circuit held that the ITC lacked authority to enjoin products of Qualcomm&#146;s customers
pursuant to a limited exclusion order because Broadcom had not named those customers as
respondents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;13, 2007, Broadcom filed a new complaint in California state court against the
Company alleging unfair competition, breach of contract and fraud, and seeking injunctive and
monetary relief. On October&nbsp;5, 2007, the court ordered the case stayed pending resolution of the
New Jersey case, referenced below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the District
of New Jersey against the Company alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and unfair
competition laws as well as common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip sales
activities, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September&nbsp;1, 2006, the
New Jersey District Court dismissed the complaint; Broadcom appealed. On September&nbsp;4, 2007, the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reinstated two of the eight federal claims and five pendant
state claims in Broadcom&#146;s complaint and affirmed the dismissal of the remaining counts. On
November&nbsp;2, 2007, Broadcom filed an amended complaint, adding the allegations from the state court
case in California (filed on April&nbsp;13, 2007) that had been stayed, as discussed above, and a
federal antitrust claim based on the California allegations. On August&nbsp;12, 2008, the New Jersey
Court ordered the case transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California. No trial date has been set.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2008, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California seeking declaratory relief regarding patent misuse, patent
exhaustion and patent and license unenforceability. The Company has not yet responded to the
complaint.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation: </I>On October&nbsp;14, 2005, the Company filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom
alleging infringement of two patents, each of which relates to video encoding and decoding for
high-end multimedia processing, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon.
In January&nbsp;2007, a jury rendered a verdict finding the patents valid but not infringed. In a
subsequent ruling, the trial judge held that the Company was not guilty of inequitable conduct
before the USPTO, but the Company&#146;s actions in a video-encoding standards development organization
amounted to a waiver of the right to enforce the patents under any circumstances. The court also
ordered the Company to pay Broadcom&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees and costs for the case. The Company and
Broadcom each filed notices of appeal, but Broadcom subsequently dismissed its appeal. Oral
argument in the Federal Circuit was held on August&nbsp;5, 2008. On January&nbsp;7, 2008, the Magistrate
Judge considering Broadcom&#146;s motions for sanctions against the Company for discovery violations
issued an order sanctioning the Company and eight of its retained outside attorneys for those
discovery violations. The Magistrate Judge referred the eight outside attorneys to the California
State Bar for an investigation into possible ethics violations and ordered the Company to
participate in a process to create a model discovery protocol. The Magistrate Judge reaffirmed the
District Court&#146;s previous award of Broadcom&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees. On March&nbsp;5, 2008, the District Court
vacated the portion of the Magistrate Judge&#146;s order only as it relates to the sanctions imposed on
the Company&#146;s outside counsel and remanded the case to the Magistrate Judge for further proceedings
on those issues.

July&nbsp;23, 2008, the Company announced that it had reached agreement with Nokia Corporation and Nokia
Inc. to resolve all pending litigation between the parties, and the parties have either obtained
dismissals or are in the process of seeking dismissal of all litigation between the parties. The
various litigation matters between the parties in different

(Broadcom, Nokia, Texas Instruments, NEC, Panasonic and Ericsson) filed complaints with the
European Commission, alleging that the Company violated European Union competition law in its WCDMA
licensing practices. The Company has received the complaints and has submitted replies to the
allegations, as well as documents and other information requested by the European Commission. On
October&nbsp;1, 2007, the European Commission announced that it was initiating a proceeding, though it
has not decided to issue a Statement of Objections, and it has not made any conclusions as to the
merits of the complaints. As part of its agreement with the Company, Nokia has withdrawn the
complaint it filed with the European Commission, although that investigation remains active.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tessera, Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On April&nbsp;17, 2007, Tessera, Inc. filed a patent
infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas and a
complaint with the ITC pursuant to Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the Company and
other companies, alleging infringement of two patents relating to semiconductor packaging
structures and seeking monetary damages and injunctive and other relief based hereon. The District
Court suit for damages is stayed pending resolution of the ITC proceeding. The ITC instituted the
investigation on May&nbsp;15, 2007. The patents at issue are being reexamined by the USPTO based on
petitions filed by a third-party. The USPTO&#146;s Central Reexamination Unit has issued office actions
rejecting all of the asserted patent claims on the grounds that they are invalid in view of certain
prior art. Tessera is contesting these rejections, and the USPTO has not made a final decision. On
February&nbsp;26, 2008, the ALJ stayed the ITC proceedings pending completion of the USPTO&#146;s
reexamination proceedings. On March&nbsp;27, 2008, the Commission reversed the ALJ&#146;s order and ordered
the ITC proceeding to be reinstated. The evidentiary hearing occurred on July&nbsp;14 through July&nbsp;18,
2008, and the investigation is targeted for completion by April&nbsp;3, 2009.

wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in purported class action
lawsuits, and individually filed actions pending in Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., seeking
monetary damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. The courts that have reviewed similar
claims against other companies to date have held that there was insufficient scientific basis for
the plaintiffs&#146; claims in those cases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2008, two complaints were filed in San Diego Federal Court and San Diego Superior
Court on behalf of purported classes of individuals who purchased UMTS devices or service, seeking
damages and injunctive relief under federal and/or state antitrust and unfair competition laws as a
result of the Company&#146;s licensing practices. The Superior Court action has been removed to the San
Diego Federal Court, and the plaintiff&#146;s request for remand has been denied. The Company has filed
motions to dismiss the complaints.

Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation of Japanese law. The Company has not
received the complaints but has submitted certain requested information and documents to the Japan
Fair Trade Commission.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the claims made by other parties are without merit and will
vigorously defend the actions. Other than amounts relating to the <I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM
Incorporated </I>matter, the Company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated
with the other legal proceedings described above based on the Company&#146;s belief that additional
liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be
estimated at this time. The Company is engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of its business and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on its operating results, liquidity or financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segment assets are comprised of accounts receivable, finance receivables and inventories for
QCT, QTL and QWI. The QSI segment assets include certain marketable securities, notes receivable,
wireless licenses, other investments and all assets of QSI&#146;s consolidated subsidiary, MediaFLO USA,
including property, plant and equipment. QSI&#146;s assets related to the MediaFLO USA business totaled
$1.2&nbsp;billion, $457&nbsp;million and $329&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;28, 2008, September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September
24, 2006, respectively. QSI&#146;s assets also included $20&nbsp;million, $16&nbsp;million and $19&nbsp;million related
to investments in equity method investees at September&nbsp;28, 2008, September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September
24, 2006, respectively. Reconciling items for total assets included $277&nbsp;million, $215&nbsp;million and
$228&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;28, 2008, September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24, 2006, respectively, of
goodwill and other assets related to the Qualcomm MEMS Technologies division (QMT), a nonreportable
segment developing display technology for mobile devices and other applications. Total segment
assets differ from total assets on a consolidated basis as a result of unallocated corporate assets
primarily comprised of certain cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, property, plant and
equipment, deferred tax assets, goodwill and other intangible assets of nonreportable segments. The
net book values of long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $100&nbsp;million, $89
million and $69&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;28, 2008, September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24, 2006,
respectively. The net book values of long-lived assets located in the United States were $2.1
billion, $1.7&nbsp;billion and $1.4&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;28, 2008, September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24,
2006, respectively.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2008, the Company acquired five businesses for total cash consideration of $260
million. Approximately $3&nbsp;million in consideration payable in cash through June&nbsp;2009 was held back
as security for certain indemnification obligations. The Company is in the process of finalizing
the accounting for the acquisitions and does not anticipate material adjustments to the preliminary
purchase price allocations. Goodwill recognized in these transactions, of which $179&nbsp;million is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes, was assigned to the QWI and QCT segments in the amount
of $179&nbsp;million and $23&nbsp;million, respectively. Technology-based intangible assets recognized in the
amount of $57&nbsp;million are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average
useful life of six years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2007, the Company acquired three businesses for total cash consideration of $181
million (of which $6&nbsp;million was paid in fiscal 2008). Goodwill recognized in these transactions,
of which $21&nbsp;million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, was assigned to the QCT and QWI
segments in the amounts of $74&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million, respectively. Technology-based intangible
assets recognized in the amount of $46&nbsp;million are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
weighted-average useful life of three years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2006, the Company acquired three businesses for an aggregate of approximately
$485&nbsp;million in cash (of which $75&nbsp;million was paid in fiscal 2007), $357&nbsp;million in shares of
QUALCOMM stock (of which $3&nbsp;million was issued in fiscal 2007), and the exchange of existing vested
options and warrants with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $38&nbsp;million. In
addition, the Company assumed existing unvested options with an estimated aggregate fair value of
$76&nbsp;million, which is recorded as share-based compensation over the requisite service period.
Goodwill recognized in these three transactions, no amount of which is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes, was assigned to the QTL and QCT segments in the amounts of $616&nbsp;million and $42
million, respectively. Technology-based intangible assets recognized in the amount of $165&nbsp;million
are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average useful life of seventeen
years. Purchased in-process technology in the amount of $22&nbsp;million was charged to research and
development expense upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and
no future alternative uses existed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of these businesses from
their respective dates of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented
