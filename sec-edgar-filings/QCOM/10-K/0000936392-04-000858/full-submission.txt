<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Overview</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication
technique called CDMA could be commercially successful in wireless
communication applications. CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access and
is one of the three main technologies currently used in digital wireless
communications networks. CDMA and the two other main digital wireless
communications technologies, TDMA (which stands for Time Division Multiple
Access) and GSM (which is a form of TDMA and stands for Global System for
Mobile Communications) are the digital technologies used to transmit a wireless
phone user&#146;s voice or data over radio waves using the wireless phone operator&#146;s
network. CDMA works by converting speech into digital information, which is
then transmitted in the form of a radio signal over the phone network. These
digital wireless phone networks are complete phone systems comprised primarily
of base stations, or &#147;cells,&#148; which are geographically placed throughout a
service or coverage area. Once communication between a wireless phone user and
a base station is established, the system detects the movement of the wireless
phone user and the communication is handed off to another base station, or
cell, as the wireless phone user moves throughout the service area.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we led the development and commercialization of CDMA technology,
we own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent
applications and trade secrets, portions of which we license to other companies
and implement in our own products. The wireless communications industry
generally recognizes that a company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell
products that use CDMA technology will require a license from us.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Subscriber growth</I></B><I>. </I>In September&nbsp;2004, EMC World Cellular Information
Service (EMC), a researcher and publisher of wireless industry market
intelligence, forecast that there will be 1.7&nbsp;billion mobile phone users, also
referred to as subscribers, by the end of this calendar year and that the
figure will grow to nearly 2.5&nbsp;billion globally by the end of 2009. Wireless
networks based on cdmaOne and CDMA2000 have been commercially deployed in 69
countries around the world. In July&nbsp;2004, In-Stat/MDR, a provider of research,
assessments and market forecasts of semiconductor and advanced communications
equipment and services, published a report estimating that CDMA2000 and WCDMA
will capture the largest market share in terms of number of subscribers by
2009. The CDMA Development Group (CDG)&nbsp;is an international consortium of
companies that joined together to lead the adoption and evolution of CDMA
wireless systems around the world. According to the CDG, from 2002 through the
first half of 2004, the CDMA subscriber base increased by an average of 30% per
year, making it the fastest growing wireless standard of all leading cellular
technologies. In June&nbsp;2004, the CDG reported that there were more than 212
million CDMA subscribers worldwide. CDMA is the leading mobile phone technology in North America with
market share of 47% at June&nbsp;2004 according to the CDG. As reported by the CDG,
the North America CDMA market has nearly 86&nbsp;million subscribers at June&nbsp;2004,
representing annual growth of 24%. In the Asian Pacific market, the largest and
fastest-growing region for CDMA, CDMA operators added nearly 26&nbsp;million
subscribers during the year ended June&nbsp;2004, bringing the total number of CDMA
subscribers in this region to over 88&nbsp;million, an increase of 41% over the
prior year. In January&nbsp;2002, China Unicom

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">launched its nationwide CDMA network, and in September&nbsp;2004, China Unicom
announced that it had nearly 26&nbsp;million CDMA subscribers. In Latin America and
the Caribbean, the number of CDMA subscribers grew by 18% during the year ended
June&nbsp;2004, reaching nearly 35&nbsp;million through 40 CDMA operators.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Next generation technologies. </I></B>We have already developed and deployed the
next generation of our CDMA technology, or what is being called 3G. Our 3G
technology, CDMA2000 1X, was first deployed commercially in October&nbsp;2000 in
South Korea. Another 3G technology, CDMA 1xEV-DO, was first deployed
commercially in January&nbsp;2002 in South Korea. As of September&nbsp;2004, South Korea
has accumulated over 31&nbsp;million CDMA2000 subscribers according to operator web
sites. As of September&nbsp;2004, there are over nine million 1xEV-DO subscribers,
most of which are in South Korea. As of September&nbsp;2004, there are at least 107
commercial 3G operators located in 48 countries. In the United States there are
14 operators that have commercially deployed CDMA2000 1X, making CDMA2000 1X the first 3G technology to be
commercially available in North America. In September&nbsp;2004, more than 500
different models of CDMA2000 user devices are being sold across all markets,
according to public reports made available at www.cdg.org.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Further investments. </I></B>We continue to invest heavily in research and
development focused on extending the market for CDMA-based products and
services. We are developing and commercializing CDMA technology and products to
support high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband,
multinetwork products that can use cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, GSM/GPRS/EDGE,
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), WCDMA, HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet
Access), FLO and all OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
networks. Among the technologies we are developing that will use these networks
are BREW, Push-to-Talk over Cellular, the MediaFLO content distribution and GPS
position location technologies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are devoting significant research and development resources to
developing high-speed wireless data and Internet access products using our CDMA
technology, including efforts to meet and exceed the standards for 3G products
set by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Many CDMA wireless phone
network operators that have integrated new features, such as Internet access,
GPS position location and advanced multimedia capabilities like digital photos
and video clips, into their products, made possible by our 3G CDMA2000 1X
technology, have experienced increased numbers of subscribers, handset
replacements and average revenue per user. Our 1xEV-DO technology also permits
CDMA wireless network providers to separately process voice transmissions and
data transmissions, allowing them to optimize each type of transmission. We
believe the transfer rate of 1xEV-DO will satisfy the demand for high-speed,
cost-effective, fixed and mobile alternatives for Internet access, competing
with digital subscriber line, cable and satellite networks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity),
are complementary to Wide Area Networks (WAN), such as CDMA2000 and WCDMA. They
both provide affordable high-speed wireless access to the World Wide Web. The
high-speed data air link and limited coverage of Wi-Fi is well suited for
private networks (e.g. enterprises, campuses and homes) and certain public &#147;hot
spots&#148; (e.g. airports, conference halls and coffee shops) where data usage is
expected to be high in a limited portable and stationary environment, whereas
3G CDMA networks are ideally suited for geographically diverse voice and data
coverage (e.g. cities, highways and neighborhoods). Because wireless operators
are looking to use Wi-Fi to extend their coverage indoors and include Wi-Fi
services in their monthly billing structure, we have begun developing our own
core chip for handling Wi-Fi services based on the 802.11 standard and plan to incorporate
it into our future multimode 3G CDMA chips. This same customer-focused and
business-driven approach is intended to be used to analyze and adopt any other
type of wireless technology or service that may exist or is being developed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to continue our active support of CDMA-based systems and the
technologies and features CDMA permits in order to grow our royalty revenues
and integrated circuit and software revenues. We also plan to continue to
broadly grant royalty-bearing licenses to our technology and patents for CDMA
and other wireless applications. From time to time, we may also make
acquisitions to meet certain technology needs, to access development resources
or to pursue new business opportunities. In October&nbsp;2004, we completed the
acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Iridigm Display
Corporation, a privately held display technology company, and Trigenix Limited,
a privately held mobile user interface company, for a total of approximately $193&nbsp;million
in cash and the exchange of stock options with an estimated aggregate fair
value of approximately $17&nbsp;million. The convergence of consumer electronics
products, including cameras, MP3 players, camcorders, GPS receivers and game
consoles, into wireless devices is driving the increased adoption of 3G CDMA.
With the inclusion of color displays in all types of phones,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">including models at the low end of the market, the cost of the display has
become an even more significant driver in the overall cost of the handset.
Iridigm&#146;s patented display technology should cost significantly less to
manufacture than a comparable liquid crystal display (LCD)&nbsp;because it requires
fewer processing steps to produce, thus enabling advanced multimedia
capabilities on all tiers of mobile devices, while providing performance, power
consumption and cost benefits as compared to alternative display technologies.
Our acquisition of Iridigm will accelerate the time to market for Iridigm&#146;s
display technology, which fits our overall strategy of rapidly increasing the
capability of wireless devices while driving down cost, size and power
consumption. Operators and device manufacturers need a secure modular
approach for customizable phone user interfaces for the branding of
handsets offered to their subscribers. Our acquisition of Trigenix
complements our BREW offering by adding Trigenix&#146;s user interface
development tools to enhance our BREW user interface capabilities and
time-to-market.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing our MediaFLO content distribution system and FLO
(Forward Link Only) technology for delivery of low cost multimedia content to
multiple subscribers. On November&nbsp;1, 2004, we announced plans for a subsidiary, MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), that will deploy and operate a nationwide mediacast network to deliver high-quality video and audio programming to third
generation mobile devices in the 700&nbsp;MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses. The mediacast network will be based on our FLO technology
and will use the MediaFLO media distribution system for content aggregation, delivery and viewing. MediaFLO USA is expected to require approximately
$800&nbsp;million in funding over the next four to five years, some of which may be provided by third parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA
products and services. Our strategy has been to invest in CDMA operators (also
known as wireless phone operators, wireless network operators, wireless service
providers or wireless operators), licensed device manufacturers and start-up
companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the
design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique
capabilities or technology. Most of our strategic investments entail a high
degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the
date of investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become liquid and
meet strategic objectives, we attempt to make regular periodic sales of our
interests in these investments that are recognized in investment income
(expense). In some cases, we make strategic investments in early stage
companies, which require us to consolidate or record our equity in losses of
those companies. These losses will adversely affect our financial results until
we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments. We also provide
financing to CDMA operators to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA
equipment by licensed manufacturers. We have a commitment to provide equipment
financing to customers of Ericsson on a shared basis with respect to Ericsson&#146;s
sale of CDMA infrastructure equipment. In November&nbsp;2001, we acquired
controlling interests in two CDMA operators in Brazil (the V&#233;sper Operating
Companies). We sold these two CDMA operators in fiscal 2004. We had a net cash
inflow from strategic investments in fiscal 2004 and plan to continue to reduce
the level of investment in wireless operators, other than investments
in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, from the levels of fiscal 2003
and before.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an international perspective, the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU)&nbsp;is the central telecommunication standards setting organization.
The ITU is recognized as an impartial, international organization within which
governments and the private sector work together to advance the development of
communications technology. The ITU&#146;s standardization activities foster the
growth of new technologies, such as mobile telephony, mobile broadcast and the
Internet, as well as the emerging global information infrastructure which
handles a mix of voice, data and rich multimedia signals. The ITU develops
internationally-agreed technical and operating standards to foster seamless
interconnection of the world&#146;s communication networks and their subsystems. As
the world of telecommunications, information technology and media content
distribution rapidly converge, the role of the ITU is to forge new
recommendations that promote the interoperability of equipment and facilitate
the development of advanced communication networks. The ITU&#146;s objective is to
identify sound technical recommendations, which are then developed into
internationally recognized ITU recommendations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)&nbsp;is the leading U.S.
based non-profit trade association serving the communications and information
technology industry. Through its worldwide activities, the TIA facilitates
business development opportunities and a competitive market environment. The
TIA provides a market-focused forum for its member companies, which manufacture
or supply the products and services used in global communications. The TIA
facilitates the convergence of new communications networks while working
towards creating a competitive and innovative market environment. The TIA is a
major contributor of voluntary industry standards that support global trade and
commerce in communications products and systems.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
Standards Development Organizations (SDO), including, among others,
the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) in the United
States, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),
the Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) in Korea, the
Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB) in Japan, and
the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), are
non-profit standards and trade associations that also serve the
communications and information technology industry. Through their
worldwide activities, these organizations work together, in conjunction with
the ITU, to develop common specifications to facilitate global
business development opportunities. They each provide a
market-focused forum for their member companies, which manufacture or
supply the products and services used in global communications. They
also facilitate the convergence of new communications networks while
working towards creating a competitive and innovative market
environment. Each organization contributes voluntary industry
standards that support global trade and commerce in communications

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the tremendous demand for wireless voice services, wireless
service providers are increasingly focused on providing wireless data services
through mobile phones, including wireless access to the Internet, multimedia
entertainment and position location services. In March&nbsp;2004, International Data
Corporation (IDC), a global market intelligence and advisory firm in the
technology and telecommunications industries, estimated that over one billion
people will be using the Internet by 2007. In May&nbsp;2004, iGillott Research, a
market strategy consultancy focused on the wireless and mobile communications
industry and collaborative applications, estimated that in 2007 over 450
million wireless subscribers will use the Internet via handsets. We
believe the growing availability of 3G-enabled handsets capable of
performing a wide variety of consumer and enterprise applications
will accelerate consumer demand for many wireless data services on a
global basis and lead to an increased replacement rate in mobile
devices using our technology and integrated circuits. High-speed and
low cost data connectivity are important to the consumer and are
driving the evolution of wireless standards. We expect that the
spread of high-speed, cost-effective wireless data access will
encourage the development of other remote supervision, position
location and telematic automobile applications. However, the demand
for such services is at an early stage of development.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of wireless standards for mobile communications by individual
countries is generally based on economic criteria and the technology preference
of the telecommunication service providers operating in those countries.
Approximately a decade ago, the European Community developed regulations
requiring the use of a telecommunication standard known as Global System for
Mobile Communications, commonly referred to as GSM. The use of this second
generation wireless standard has spread throughout the world and is currently
the basis for approximately 73% of the digital mobile communications in use
according to EMC. The majority of the more than one billion GSM
subscribers are expected to migrate to third generation CDMA services
before the end of this decade.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant growth in the use of wireless phones worldwide and demand
for enhanced network functionality requires constant innovation to further
improve network reliability, expand capacity and introduce new types of
services. To meet these requirements, progressive generations of wireless
telecommunications technology standards have evolved.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>First Generation. </I></B>The first generation of wireless telecommunications,
widely adopted in the late 1980s, was based on analog technology. While this
generation helped increase the adoption of wireless telecommunications, the
technology was characterized by inherent capacity limitations, minimal data
transfer capabilities, low security, inconsistent service levels and
significant power consumption.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Second Generation. </I></B>As the deployment of mobile phone systems grew, the
limitations of analog technology drove the development of second generation,
digital-based technologies, which are the primary technology standards

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">in use today. Second generation digital technology provided for
significantly enhanced efficiency within a broadcast spectrum as well as
greatly increased capacity compared to analog systems. Second generation
technologies also enabled numerous enhanced services, including paging, e-mail
and facsimile, connections to computer networks, greater privacy, lower prices,
a greater number of service options and greater fraud protection. The three
main second-generation digital technologies are CDMA, called cdmaOne or
IS-95A/B, a technology we developed and patented, TDMA and GSM, a form of TDMA.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second generation CDMA technology offers 10 to 20 times the capacity
of analog systems and more than three times the capacity of TDMA- and GSM-based
systems through more efficient utilization of wireless operators&#146; licensed
spectrum. Some of the advantages of CDMA technology over both analog and TDMA-
and GSM-based technologies include enhanced call security, increased network
capacity, network flexibility, compatibility with Internet protocols, lower
power requirements, higher capacity for data and faster access to data
(Internet), higher data throughput rates and easier transition to 3G networks.
GSM has the benefit of roaming, being readily available as a result
of the GSMA&#146;s mandate. Currently, GSM low end handsets are somewhat
lower priced than CDMA handsets, although this differential is diminishing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many GSM operators are deploying 2.5G mobile packet data technologies,
such as GPRS and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution), as a bridging
technology, while they wait for 3G WCDMA devices to become readily available.
We do not believe that GPRS and EDGE effectively compete with 3G CDMA-based
packet data services, either on a cost or performance basis, although these
technologies have been deployed in GSM networks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Third Generation. </I></B>As demand for wireless networks that carry both data and
voice traffic at faster speeds has increased significantly, several 3G wireless
standards were proposed to the ITU by a variety of companies and alliances.
These proposals include both CDMA- and TDMA-based technologies. A technology
standard selected for 3G must efficiently support significantly increased data
speeds and capacity over limited spectrum bandwidth, thereby enabling new and
enhanced services and applications such as mobile e-commerce, position location
and mobile multimedia web browsing, including music and video downloads.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>CDMA-Based 3G Technology. </I></B>In May&nbsp;2000, the ITU adopted the 3G standard
known as IMT-2000, which encompasses five terrestrial operating modes, three of
them based on our CDMA intellectual property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three IMT-2000 CDMA modes are:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;CDMA2000, also known as Multi-Carrier, which includes CDMA2000
1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;WCDMA, also known as Direct Spread or UMTS; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;Time Division Duplex, also known as TDD or TD-SCDMA.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
two operating modes not based on CDMA are DECT&#043; and  UWC-136,
also known as Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) for IS-136 TDMA and
GSM-based networks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two current commercial versions of CDMA2000 are: CDMA2000 1X and
1xEV-DO. These versions use a 1.25 megahertz (MHz) channel bandwidth to provide
both voice communications and high-speed wireless data. CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO
utilizes the same standard channel bandwidth as existing cdmaOne systems and,
as a result, is compatible with wireless telecommunications operators&#146; existing
network equipment, making the migration to 3G simple and affordable. We believe
CDMA2000 1X provides approximately twice the voice capacity of cdmaOne and six
to eight times that of TDMA-based networks. Additionally, a hybrid approach
that utilizes signals from both the GPS satellite constellation and CDMA cell
sites, and is also available for non-CDMA networks, has enabled CDMA system operators to meet the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC)&nbsp;mandate requiring wireless operators to implement enhanced 911
(E911) wireless emergency location services. In the future, the performance of
CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO is expected to increase. Other enhancements, such as
multicast services, higher-resolution displays, longer battery life,
push-to-talk services and voice over Internet protocol are becoming available
to improve the user experience and operator profitability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1X began in October&nbsp;2000 in South Korea
where more than 31&nbsp;million, or approximately 85%, of the nation&#146;s total mobile
service users were using this technology by the end of September&nbsp;2004.
Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1X in North America, Brazil and Romania began
in December&nbsp;2001. KDDI commercially deployed CDMA2000 1X in Japan in April&nbsp;2002
and reported more than 15&nbsp;million CDMA2000 1X subscribers as of
August&nbsp;2004. In January 2002, China Unicom launched its
nationwide CDMA network and had nearly 26&nbsp;million CDMA
subscribers at the end of September 2004. In May 2003, Reliance
Infocomm launched its nationwide CDMA network in India and had over
nine million subscribers at the end of September 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO began in January&nbsp;2002 in South
Korea with the introduction of SKT&#146;s high-speed mobile multimedia and broadcast
service called &#147;June.&#148; As of September&nbsp;2004, SKT and KTF

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">reported more than nine million CDMA2000 1xEV-DO subscribers in Korea.
Today, more than 80% of the CDMA market is in various stages of 1xEV-DO
deployments and trials. For example, Verizon Wireless in the United States and
KDDI in Japan began their nationwide roll-out of 1xEV-DO services on October&nbsp;1,
2003 and November&nbsp;28, 2003, respectively. As of September&nbsp;2004, KDDI had more
than one million 1xEV-DO subscribers. On August&nbsp;2, 2004, Eurotel, a CDMA450
operator in the Czech Republic, became the first European operator to deploy
1xEV-DO in Europe. Sprint PCS has also announced its plans to begin its
nationwide roll-out of 1xEV-DO-based services starting in the autumn of 2004.
As of October&nbsp;2004, ten wireless phone operators have commercially deployed our
CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology in South Korea, the United States, Japan, Brazil,
Guatemala, Romania and the Czech Republic. More than a dozen other operators
have publicly announced trials and are in the process of rolling out 1xEV-DO
commercially over the next 12&nbsp;months.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing greater adoption of 1xEV-DO among operators worldwide.
Consequently, commercial deployments of 1xEV-DV are uncertain, yet may possibly
occur in the future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Community has focused primarily on the second mode of the
IMT-2000 standard, known as WCDMA, which is based on our underlying CDMA
technology. Most all of the world&#146;s leading wireless phone and infrastructure
manufacturers have licensed our technology, enabling them to utilize this WCDMA
mode of the 3G technology. Our 3G CDMA licensees include Siemens, Nokia,
Ericsson, Motorola, Lucent, Samsung, LG Electronics, Hitachi, NEC, Nortel,
Toshiba, Sanyo, Sharp, Fujitsu, Denso, Agilent, Alcatel, Matsushita,
Mitsubishi, and Kyocera, among others. We expect a significant growth in the
WCDMA subscriber base over the next five years mostly in Japan (led
by NTT DoCoMo) and Europe; thus, we have allocated a
significant amount of engineering, production and business resources to
adequately support this large growth opportunity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TD-SCDMA mode is the least developed of the 3G CDMA alternatives.
Support for the development of this version of the 3G technologies has been
provided by the Chinese government.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three 3G CDMA wireless operating modes discussed above are all based
on the underlying core principles of CDMA technology; however, the CDMA2000
mode enables a direct and relatively more economical conversion for current
cdmaOne networks. WCDMA has been specifically designed to operate in GSM
networks. We will continue to develop integrated circuits for the CDMA2000 and
WCDMA modes, and expect to develop integrated circuits for all other modes of
the 3G standard based on CDMA. In addition, our intellectual property rights
include core and primary patents utilized by each of the 3G CDMA alternatives,
and the royalty rate to be paid to us by subscriber unit licensees
for 3G CDMA products is no less than the rate that a licensee will pay for second generation
cdmaOne products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three 3G CDMA wireless operating modes require separate
implementations and are not interchangeable from a technological perspective.
While the fundamental core technologies are derived from CDMA and are covered
by our patents, they each require unique infrastructure products, network
design and management. They are however being linked through multimode wireless
devices.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry in the United
States and throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace, as
businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of
telecommunications services. We have facilitated competition in the CDMA market by licensing a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a major position in the industry,
 many of
our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us, including:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These competitors may have more established relationships and greater
technical, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities and greater access to
channels in markets not currently deploying wireless communications technology.
These competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic
relationships among themselves or with our existing or potential customers,
resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers&#146;
decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new
competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire
significant market share to our detriment. In addition, many of these companies
are licensees of our technology and have established market positions, trade
names, trademarks, patents, copyrights, intellectual property rights and
substantial technological capabilities. We may face competition throughout the
world with new technologies and services introduced in the future as additional
competitors enter the market place for products based on 3G standards. Although
we intend to continuously develop improvements to existing technologies, as
well as potentially new technologies, there may be a continuing competitive
threat from companies introducing alternative versions of wireless
technologies. We also expect that the price we charge for our products and
services may continue to decline as competition intensifies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QCT Segment. </I></B>The markets in which our QCT segment operates are intensely
competitive. QCT competes worldwide with a number of United States and
international semiconductor designers and manufacturers. As a result of the
trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and
technological and public policy changes, we anticipate that additional
competitors will enter this market. We believe that the principal competitive
factors for CDMA integrated circuit providers to our addressed markets are
product performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry
standards, price, time to market, system cost, design and engineering
capabilities, new product innovation and customer support. The specific bases
on which we compete against alternative CDMA integrated circuit providers vary
by product platform. We also compete against alternative wireless
communications technologies including, but not limited to,
GSM/GPRS/EDGE, TDMA and
analog.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s current competitors include major semiconductor companies such as
Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Freescale, VIA Telecom, NEC, Infineon
and Philips, as well as major telecommunication equipment companies such as
Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Matsushita, who design their own
integrated circuits and software for certain products. QCT also faces
competition from some start-up ventures.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitors may devote a significantly greater amount of their
financial, technical, marketing and other resources to aggressively market
competitive telecommunications systems or to develop and adopt competitive
digital cellular technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely
affect QCT. Moreover, competitors may

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">offer more attractive product pricing or financing terms than we do as a
means of gaining access to the wireless telecommunications markets.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have entered into licensing agreements with certain companies,
including Philips, Motorola, Lucent, Texas Instruments, VIA Telecom,
PrairieComm, NEC, EoNex Technologies and Infineon. These licenses permit the
licensees to manufacture CDMA-based integrated circuits using certain of our
intellectual property for sale to CDMA-based phone manufacturers. In exchange
for granting the licenses, we are entitled to receive license fees, royalties
(payable as a percentage of the selling price of the integrated circuits)
and/or royalty-free cross-licenses, which allow us to use these companies&#146; CDMA
and, in some cases, non-CDMA intellectual property for specified purposes. In
every case, the phone manufacturers&#146; sales of CDMA-based phones are subject to
the payment of royalties to us on the products into which the integrated
circuits are incorporated in accordance with the manufacturers&#146; separate
licensing arrangements with us. We license our CDMA intellectual property to
the competitors of our QCT segment to support the deployment of CDMA-based
systems and technologies worldwide in order to grow our royalty revenues from
customers licensed to sell CDMA phones and equipment. We believe that, if the
use of CDMA expands sufficiently, QCT&#146;s business will also grow, even if we
lose market share. Also, our QTL segment will receive royalties from sales of
CDMA integrated circuits by certain competitors of QCT. To date, most cdmaOne
and CDMA2000 phone manufacturer licensees have elected to purchase their
CDMA-based integrated circuits from us.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QTL Segment</I></B><B>. </B>As part of our strategy to generate new and ongoing licensing
revenues, significant resources are allocated to develop leading edge
technology for the telecommunications industry. We face competition in the
development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless
communications technology and services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a worldwide basis, we currently compete primarily with two digital
wireless telecommunications technologies, TDMA and GSM/GPRS. TDMA has been
deployed primarily in the United States and Latin America. Variations of TDMA
have also been deployed in other countries, such as PDC (Personal Digital
Cellular) in Japan and PAS (Personal Access System) in China. GSM has been
extensively utilized in Europe, much of Asia other than Japan and Korea, and
certain other markets. To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than CDMA,
however, CDMA technologies have been adopted for all third generation
wireless systems. WCDMA, a technology
designed as an alternative to CDMA2000, is an approved 3G standard and has been
adopted by several European, Japanese and United States operators. We expect
that, although a considerable number of limited systems have been placed in
service (e.g., the largest commercial WCDMA system is that of NTT DoCoMo in
Japan with over six million subscribers as of September&nbsp;30, 2004), widespread
WCDMA networks will not begin commercial operation until late 2004 or later. In
addition, many GSM operators have deployed or are expected to deploy GPRS, a
packet data technology, as a 2.5G bridge technology, and some GSM operators
plan to deploy EDGE, while waiting for third generation WCDMA to become
available and/or more cost effective for their system. A limited number of
operators have started testing OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing Access) technology, a multi-carrier transmission technique not
based on CDMA technology, that divides the available spectrum into many
carriers, with each carrier being modulated at a low data rate relative to the
combined rate for all carriers.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QWI Segment. </I></B>Existing competitors of our QWBS division offering
alternatives to our OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, T2 Untethered
TrailerTRACS, GlobalTRACS, QConnect, EutelTRACS, OmniOne and LINQ system
products are aggressively pricing their products and services and could
continue to do so in the future. In addition, these competitors are offering
new value-added products and services similar in many cases to our existing or
developing technologies. Emergence of new competitors, particularly those
offering low cost terrestrial-based products and current as well as future
satellite-based systems, may impact margins and intensify competition in new
markets. Similarly, some original equipment manufacturers of trucks and truck
components are beginning to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">offer built-in, on-board communications and position location reporting
systems that may impact our margins and intensify competition in our current
and new markets.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors to our BREW platform are continuing to develop their products
with a focus on client, provisioning, and billing products and services. These
competitors are attempting to offer value added products and services similar,
in many cases, to our existing or developing BREW technologies. In some cases,
competitors are continuing to explicitly attempt to displace only certain
components or areas of the greater BREW offering, such as only the runtime
client/device environment portion of BREW. In addition, certain competitors in
the computing industry and device manufacturing space are now beginning to more
aggressively attempt to replicate the entire BREW system offering that includes
both runtime device environments and billing/distribution systems. Similarly,
some operators are creating internally developed solutions by piecing together
several components or are being pressured by governments to adopt alternatives
to our products and services. Emergence of these and other new competitors may
adversely impact our margins and market share.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks
and proprietary information to maintain and enhance our competitive position.
We have been granted more than 1,300 United States patents and have over 2,000
patent applications pending in the United States. The vast majority of such
patents and patent applications relate to our CDMA digital wireless
communications technology. We also have and will continue to actively file for
patent protection outside the United States and have received numerous CDMA
patents with broad coverage throughout most of the world, including China,
Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil, India and elsewhere.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standards bodies and the ITU have been informed that we hold essential
intellectual property rights for the 3G standards that are based on CDMA. We
have committed to the ITU to license our essential patents for these CDMA
standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from unfair discrimination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our CDMA license agreements, licensees are generally required to pay
us a non-refundable license fee as well as ongoing royalties based on a
percentage of the net selling price of CDMA subscriber, infrastructure, test
and integrated circuits products. License fees are paid in one or more
installments, while royalties generally continue throughout the life of the
licensed patents. Our CDMA license agreements generally provide us rights to
use certain of our licensees&#146; technology and intellectual property rights to
manufacture and sell certain CDMA products (e.g. CDMA application specific
integrated circuits or ASICs, subscriber units and/or infrastructure
equipment). In most cases, our use of our licensees&#146; technology and
intellectual property is royalty free. However, under some of the licenses, if
we incorporate certain of the licensed technology or intellectual property into
certain of our products, we are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such
products. Under their existing agreements with us, two entities are
entitled to share in a percentage of the royalty revenues that we
receive from third parties for their sale of certain
CDMA products. Our sharing
obligations under one of these arrangements expire in fiscal 2005 and the other in fiscal 2006.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our strategy to generate licensing revenues and support
worldwide adoption of our CDMA technology, we license to other companies the
rights to design, manufacture and sell products utilizing certain portions of
our CDMA intellectual property. The following table lists the majority of our
current CDMA licensees:

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RISK FACTORS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other
information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects.
The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any
of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could
be harmed. In that case the trading price of our common stock could decline.
You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report,
including our financial statements and the related notes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Businesses</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>If CDMA technology is not widely deployed, our revenues may not grow as
anticipated.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus our business primarily on developing, patenting and
commercializing CDMA technology for wireless telecommunications applications.
Other digital wireless communications technologies, particularly GSM
technology, have been more widely deployed than CDMA technology. If CDMA
technology does not become the preferred wireless communications industry
standard in the countries where our products and those of our customers and
licensees are sold, or if wireless operators do not select CDMA for their
networks or update their current networks to any CDMA-based third generation
technology, our business and financial results could suffer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase our revenues and market share in future periods, we are
dependent upon the commercial deployment of third generation (3G) wireless
communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA technology.
Although network operators have commercially deployed CDMA2000 1X and WCDMA, we
cannot predict the timing or success of further commercial deployments of
CDMA2000 1X, WCDMA or other CDMA systems. If existing deployments are not
commercially successful, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000 1X, WCDMA
or other CDMA systems are delayed or unsuccessful, our business and financial
results may be harmed. In addition, our business could be harmed if network
operators deploy competing technologies or switch existing networks from CDMA
to GSM or if network operators introduce new technologies. For example, a
limited number of operators have started testing OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing Access) technology, a multi-carrier transmission
technique not based on CDMA technology, that divides the available spectrum
into many carriers, with each carrier being modulated at a low data rate
relative to the combined rate for all carriers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business and the deployment of CDMA technology are dependent on the
success of our customers and licensees. Our customers and licensees may incur
lower operating margins on CDMA-based products than on products using
alternative technologies due to greater competition in the CDMA-based market,
lack of product improvements or other factors. If CDMA handset and/or
infrastructure manufacturers exit the CDMA market, the deployment of CDMA
technology could be negatively affected, and our business could suffer.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Our three largest customers as of September&nbsp;30, 2004 accounted for 40%, 44% and
36% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
loss of any one of our major customers or any reduction in the demand for
devices utilizing our CDMA technology could reduce our revenues and harm our
ability to achieve or sustain desired levels of operating results.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QCT Segment. </I>The loss of any one of our QCT segment&#146;s significant
customers or the delay, even if only temporary, or cancellation of significant
orders from any of these customers would reduce our revenues in the period of
the cancellation or deferral and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain
desired levels of profitability. Accordingly, unless and until our QCT segment
diversifies and expands its customer base, our future success will
significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchase orders, if
any, from these customers. Factors that may impact the size and timing of
orders from customers of our QCT segment include, among others, the following:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QTL Segment. </I>Our QTL segment derives royalty revenues from sales of CDMA
products by our licensees. We derive a significant portion of our royalty
revenue from a limited number of licensees. Our future success depends upon the
ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high volume products
that achieve and sustain market acceptance. We have little or no control over
the sales efforts of our licensees, and we cannot assure you that our licensees
will be successful or that the demand for wireless communications devices and
services offered by our licensees will continue to increase. Any reduction in
the demand for or any delay in the development, introduction or delivery of
wireless communications devices utilizing our CDMA technology could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Weakness in the value of foreign
currencies in which our customers&#146; products are sold may reduce the amount of
royalties payable to us in U.S. dollars.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>We depend upon a limited number of third party manufacturers to provide
component parts, subassemblies and finished goods for our products. Any
disruptions in the operations of, or the loss of, any of these third parties
could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers and
increase our cost of sales.</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to meet customer demands depends, in part, on our ability to
obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers
and our manufacturing capacity. A reduction or interruption in component
supply, an inability of our partners to react to rapid shifts in demand or a
significant increase in component prices could have a material adverse effect
on our business or profitability. Component shortages could adversely affect
our ability and that of our customers to ship products on a timely basis and
our customers&#146; demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or declines in
demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain
desired levels of profitability. Additionally, failure to meet customer demand
in a timely manner could damage our reputation and harm our customer
relationships potentially resulting in reduced market share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QCT Segment. </I>We subcontract all of the manufacturing and assembly, and
most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. We depend upon a limited
number of third parties to perform these functions, some of which are only
available from single sources with which we do not have long-term contracts.
IBM, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and United Microelectronics are the
primary foundry partners for our family of baseband integrated circuits. IBM,
Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductor) and Atmel are the primary foundry
partners for our family of radio frequency and analog integrated circuits. Our
reliance on a sole-source vendor primarily occurs during the start-up phase of
a new product. Once a new product reaches a significant volume level, we
typically establish alternative suppliers for technologies that we consider
critical. Our reliance on sole or limited-

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">source vendors involves risks. These risks include possible shortages of
capacity, product performance shortfalls and reduced controls over delivery
schedules, manufacturing capability, quality assurance, quantity and costs.
During fiscal 2004, we experienced supply constraints which resulted in our
inability to meet certain customer demands. To ensure better delivery of parts
and components from our suppliers, we have increased and extended our firm
orders to our suppliers. Additionally, we continue to add capacity at existing
suppliers, as well as evaluate potential new suppliers to augment our needs. We
expect costs of certain integrated circuit products could increase as a result
of our efforts to increase the availability of components in short supply. We
work closely with customers to expedite their processes for evaluating products
from our new foundry suppliers; however, in some instances, transition to new
product supply may cause a temporary decline in shipments of specific products
to individual customers. To the extent that our firm commitments from our
manufacturers are insufficient to meet demand over a specific time period or in
any specific quantity, our manufacturers may allocate, and in the past have
allocated, capacity to the production of other products while reducing
deliveries to us on short notice.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations may also be harmed by lengthy or recurring disruptions at
any of the facilities of our manufacturers and may be harmed by disruptions in
the distribution channels from our suppliers and to our customers. These
disruptions may include labor strikes, work stoppages, widespread illness,
terrorism, war, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. These
disruptions could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to
shift the products from an affected manufacturer to another manufacturer. The
loss of a significant third-party manufacturer or the inability of a
third-party manufacturer to meet performance and quality specifications or
delivery schedules could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to
our customers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, one or more of our manufacturers may obtain licenses from us
to manufacture CDMA integrated circuits that compete with our products. In this
event, the manufacturer could elect to allocate scarce components and
manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce deliveries to us. In
the event of a loss of or a decision to change a key third-party manufacturer,
qualifying a new manufacturer and commencing volume production or testing could
involve delay and expense, resulting in lost revenues, reduced operating
margins and possible loss of customers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QWI Segment. </I>Several of the critical subassemblies and parts used in our
QWBS division&#146;s existing and proposed products are currently available only
from third-party single or limited sources. These include items such as
electronic and radio frequency components, and other sophisticated parts and
subassemblies which are used in the OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, T2
Untethered TrailerTRACS, GlobalTRACS and EutelTRACS products. These third
parties include companies such as Tyco International (M/A Com), Rakon,
Mini-Circuits, Cambridge Tool &#038; Mfg., Andrew Corporation, American Design,
Deutsch ECD, PCI Limited, KeyTronic EMS, Danaher Motors, Fujitsu Corporation,
Tectrol, uBlox, Navman NZ, Eagle-Picher Industries, Sony/Ericsson and Sharp
Corporation. Our reliance on sole or limited source vendors involves risks.
These risks include possible shortages of certain key components, product
performance shortfalls, and reduced control over delivery schedules,
manufacturing capability, quality and costs. In the event of a long-term supply
interruption, alternate sources could be developed in a majority of the cases.
The inability to obtain adequate quantities of significant compliant materials
on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, liquidity and financial position.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>We are subject to the risks of our and our licensees conducting business
outside the United States.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant part of our strategy involves our continued pursuit of
growth opportunities in a number of international markets. We market, sell and
service our products internationally. We have established sales offices around
the world. We expect to continue to expand our international sales operations
and enter new international markets. This expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and
indirect international sales and support channels, and we cannot assure you
that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not
exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. If we are not able to maintain or
increase international market demand for our products and technologies, we may
not be able to maintain a desired rate of growth in our business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated revenues from international customers as a percentage of
total revenues were 79%, 77% and 69% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Because most of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S.
dollars, our products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold in
U.S. dollars become less price-competitive in international markets if the
value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to general risks associated with our international sales,
licensing activities and operations, we are also subject to risks specific to
the individual countries in which we do business. Declines in currency values
in selected regions may adversely affect our operating results because our
products and those of our customers and licensees may become more expensive to
purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. During fiscal 2004, 43%
and 18% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in South Korea
and Japan, respectively, as compared to 45% and 15%, respectively, during
fiscal 2003, and 39% and 18% during fiscal 2002, respectively. A significant
downturn in the economies of Asian countries where many of our customers and
licensees are located, particularly the economies of South Korea and Japan, or
the economies of the major markets they serve would materially harm our
business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wireless markets in China and India represent growth opportunities for
us. In January&nbsp;2002, China Unicom launched its nationwide CDMA network and had
nearly 26&nbsp;million CDMA subscribers at the end of September&nbsp;2004. In May&nbsp;2003,
Reliance Infocomm launched its nationwide CDMA network in India and had over
nine million subscribers at the end of September&nbsp;2004. If China Unicom or
Reliance Infocomm or the governments of China or India make technology
deployment or other decisions that result in actions that are adverse to the
expansion of CDMA technologies in China or India, our business could be harmed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless
operators provide subsidies on phone sales to their customers. Increases in
phone prices that negatively impact phone sales can result from changes in
regulatory policies related to phone subsidies. Limitations or changes in
policy on phone subsidies in South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may
have additional negative impacts on our revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that royalty revenues from international licensees based upon
sales of their products outside of the United States will continue to represent
a significant portion of our total revenues in the future. Our royalty revenues
from international licensees are denominated in U.S. dollars. To the extent
that such licensees&#146; products are sold in foreign currencies, any royalties
that we derive as a result of such sales are subject to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates. In addition, if the effective price of products sold
by our customers were to increase as a result of

charges or management disruption and fail to enhance stockholder value.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we engage in strategic transactions with the goal of
maximizing stockholder value. In the past we have acquired businesses, entered
into joint ventures and made strategic investments in or loans to CDMA wireless
operators, early stage companies, or venture funds to support global adoption
of CDMA and the use of the wireless Internet. Most of our strategic investments
entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one
year from the date of investment, if at all. We cannot assure you that our
strategic investments (either those we currently hold or future investments)
will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption
or continued use of CDMA technologies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions and
alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. These potential
future transactions may include a variety of different business arrangements,
including acquisitions, spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,
restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and equity or debt
investments. Although our goal is to maximize stockholder value, such
transactions may impair stockholder value or otherwise adversely affect our
business and the trading price of our stock. Any such transaction may require
us to incur non-recurring or other charges and/or to consolidate or record our
equity in losses and may pose significant integration challenges and/or
management and business disruptions, any of which could harm our operating
results and business.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors
that are detected only when the products are in use. Further, because our
products and services are responsible for critical functions in our customers&#146;
products and/or networks, such defects or errors could have a serious impact on
our customers, which could damage our reputation, harm our customer
relationships and expose us to liability. Defects or impurities in our
components, materials or software or those used by our customers or licensees,
equipment failures or other difficulties could adversely affect our ability and
that of our customers and licensees to ship products on a timely basis as well
as customer or licensee demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or
declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or
sustain desired levels of profitability. We and our customers or licensees may
also experience component or software failures or defects which could require
significant product recalls, reworks and/or repairs which are not covered by
warranty reserves and which could consume a substantial portion of the capacity
of our third-party manufacturers or those of our customers or licensees.
Resolving any defect or failure related issues could consume financial and/or
engineering resources that could affect future product release schedules.
Additionally, a defect or failure in our products or the products of our
customers or licensees could harm our reputation and/or adversely affect the
growth of 3G wireless markets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry
could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global economic weakness can have wide-ranging effects on markets that we
serve, particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network
operators. The wireless communications industry recently appears to be
recovering from an industry-wide recession. We cannot predict whether a
recovery will continue, the rate of any such recovery, or what effects negative
events, such as war, may have on the economy or on phone inventories at CDMA
equipment manufacturers and operators. The continued threat of terrorism and
heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any
future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the global economy
and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties.
Further, an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term. If it does
not, our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may
be impaired. In addition, because we intend to continue to make significant
investments in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing
customer service and support capability, any decline in the rate of growth of
our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Our industry is subject to competition that could result in decreased demand
for our products and the products of our customers and licensees and/or
declining average selling prices for our licensees&#146; products and our products,
negatively affecting our revenues and operating results.</I>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This competition may result in reduced average selling prices for our
products and those of our customers and licensees. Reductions in the average
selling price of our licensees&#146; products, unless offset by an increase in
volumes, generally result in reduced royalties payable to us. While pricing
pressures from competition may, to a large extent, be mitigated by the
introduction of new features and functionality in our licensees&#146; products,
there is no guarantee that such mitigation will occur. We anticipate that
additional competitors will enter our markets as a result of growth
opportunities in wireless telecommunications, the trend toward global expansion
by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy changes
and relatively low barriers to entry in selected segments of the industry.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitors include companies that promote non-CDMA technologies and
companies that design competing CDMA integrated circuits, such as Nokia,
Motorola, Philips, Ericsson, Texas Instruments, Intel, NEC, Nortel, VIA
Telecom, Samsung, Matsushita and Siemens. All of the foregoing are also our
licensees, with the exception of Intel. With respect to our OmniTRACS,
TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS, GlobalTRACS, QConnect,
OmniOne, EutelTRACS and LINQ products and services, our existing competitors
are aggressively pricing their products and services and could continue to do
so in the future. In addition, these competitors are offering new value-added
products and services similar in many cases to those we have developed or are
developing. Emergence of new competitors, particularly those offering low cost
terrestrial-based products and current as well as future satellite-based
products, may impact margins and intensify competition in current and new
markets. Similarly, some original equipment manufacturers of trucks and truck
components are beginning to offer built-in, on-board communications and
position location reporting products that may impact our margins and intensify
competition in our current and new markets. Some potential competitors of our
QWBS business, if they are successful, may harm our ability to compete in
certain markets.

successful than us. In addition, we anticipate additional competitors will
enter the market for products based on 3G standards. These competitors may have
more established relationships and distribution channels in markets not
currently deploying wireless communications technology. These competitors also
may have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships
among themselves or with our existing or potential customers, resellers or
other third parties. These relationships may affect our customers&#146; decisions to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future earnings and stock price may be subject to volatility,
particularly on a quarterly basis. Shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in
any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could
immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common
stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may repurchase our common stock at prices that may
later be higher than the fair market value of the stock. This could result in a
loss of value for stockholders if the shares were reissued at lower prices.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its
securities. Due to changes in the volatility of our stock price, we may be the
target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could
result in substantial costs and divert management&#146;s attention and resources. In
addition, stock volatility may be precipitated by failure to meet earnings
expectations or other factors, such as the potential uncertainty in future
reported earnings created by the adoption of option expensing and the related
valuation models used to determine such expense.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to develop and
introduce new products, technology and enhancements on a timely basis. Our
future success will also depend on our ability to keep pace with technological
developments, protect our intellectual property, satisfy varying customer
requirements, price our products competitively and achieve market acceptance.
The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of
new industry standards could render our existing products and technology, and
products and technology currently under development, obsolete and unmarketable.
If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments or
customer requirements, or experience any significant delays in development,
introduction or shipment of our products and technology in commercial
quantities, demand for our products and our customers&#146; and licensees&#146; products
that use our technology could decrease, and our competitive position could be
damaged.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be
expensive and could divert our valuable resources.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws,
as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to
protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our
patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products and technologies is
difficult and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken
will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary
information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws
may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or as readily as United States
laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of our patents and patent applications relate to our
CDMA digital wireless communications technology and much of the remainder of
our patents and patent applications relate to our other technologies and
products. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property
rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of
proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose
our proprietary rights or incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any
action we take to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and
could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could
negatively impact our operating results. In addition, failure to protect our
trademark rights could impair our brand identity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property or that
patents on which we rely are invalid could adversely affect our business.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, companies may assert patent, copyright and other
intellectual proprietary rights against our products or products using our
technologies or technologies used in our industry. These claims may result in
our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given the
complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property
litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe on protected
technology, we could be required to redesign or license such technology and/or
pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party. If we were unable to
redesign or license protected technology used in our products, we could be
prohibited from making and selling such products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as the number of competitors in our market increases and the
functionality of our products is enhanced and overlaps with the products of
other companies, we may become subject to claims of infringement or

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others. Any
claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly
litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or
cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have a material
adverse effect upon our operating results. In any potential dispute involving
our patents or other intellectual property, our licensees could also become the
targets of litigation. Any such litigation could severely disrupt the business
of our licensees, which in turn could hurt our relations with our licensees and
cause our revenues to decrease.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of other companies have claimed to own patents essential to
various 3G CDMA standards. If we or other product manufacturers are required to
obtain additional licenses and/or pay royalties to one or more patent holders,
this could have a material adverse effect on the commercial implementation of
our CDMA products and technologies and our profitability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other companies or entities also may commence actions seeking to establish
the invalidity of our patents. In the event that one or more of our patents are
challenged, a court may invalidate the patent or determine that the patent is
not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If any of our key
patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents
is limited by court decision, we could be prevented from licensing the
invalidated or limited portion of our technology. Even if such a patent
challenge is not successful, it could be expensive and time consuming, divert
management attention from our business and harm our reputation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous
foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business,
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.
Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination
of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than
that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. In
such case, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the
period or periods in which that determination is made could result.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses and
deploy and expand wireless networks could slow the growth of the wireless
communications industry and adversely affect our business.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications
services that utilize our CDMA technology. In order to provide wireless
communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific
radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United
States and other countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected
by the amount of capital required to: obtain licenses to use new frequencies;
deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services; and expand wireless
networks to grow voice and data services. Over the last several years, the
amount paid for spectrum licenses has increased significantly, particularly for
frequencies used in connection with 3G technology. In addition, litigation and
disputes involving prior and future spectrum auctions has delayed the expansion
of wireless networks in the United States and elsewhere, and it is possible
that this delay could continue for a significant amount of time. The
significant cost of licenses and wireless networks, and delays associated with
disputes over new licenses, may slow the growth of the industry if wireless
operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to
implement 3G wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely affected if this
occurs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>If we experience product liability claims or recalls, we may incur significant
expenses and experience decreased demand for our products.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our products and those of our
licensees and customers entails the risk of product liability. Although we
believe our product liability insurance will be adequate to protect against
product liability claims, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue
to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to
protect us against losses due to product liability. Our inability to maintain
insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential
product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our
products and those of our licensees and customers and harm our future operating
results. Furthermore, not all losses associated with alleged product failure
are insurable. In addition, a product liability claim or recall, whether
against us, our licensees or customers, could harm our reputation and result in
decreased demand for our products.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>If wireless phones pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and
demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers may decrease.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded,
may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless phones, which would
decrease demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers. In
recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the
guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from
radio equipment, including wireless phones. In addition, interest groups have
requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications
technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing
aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over the
possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use
of wireless phones while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in
response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for our products
and those of our licensees and customers in the United States as well as
foreign countries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Our business depends on the availability of satellite and other networks for
our OmniTRACS, EutelTRACS, OmniExpress, LINQ, T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS,
GlobalTRACS, QConnect and OmniOne systems and other communications products.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our OmniTRACS system currently operates in the United States market on
leased Ku-band satellite transponders. Our primary data satellite transponder
and position reporting satellite transponder lease runs through October&nbsp;2006
and includes transponder and satellite protection (back-up capacity in the
event of a transponder or satellite failure). Based on system capacity
analysis, we believe that the United States OmniTRACS operations will not
require additional transponder capacity through fiscal 2006. We believe that in
the event additional transponder capacity would be required in fiscal 2006 or
in future years, additional capacity will be available on acceptable terms.
However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire additional
transponder capacity on acceptable terms in a timely manner. A failure to
maintain adequate satellite capacity would harm our business, operating
results, liquidity and financial position.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our OmniExpress, LINQ, T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS, GlobalTRACS, QConnect
and OmniOne systems are terrestrial-based products and thus rely on various
wireless terrestrial communications networks operated by third parties. We
believe these terrestrial networks will be available for our products; however,
we cannot assure you that these networks will continue to be available to us or
that they will perform adequately for our needs. The unavailability or
nonperformance of these network systems could harm our business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the
existence of a Disaster Recovery Plan for our internal information technology
networking systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer
viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism,
war and telecommunication failures. Any system failure, accident or security
breach that causes interruptions in our operations or to our customers&#146; or
licensees&#146; operations could result in a material disruption to our business. To
the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage
to our customers&#146; data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of
confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we
may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or
security breaches.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message transmissions for domestic OmniTRACS, T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS,
OmniExpress, GlobalTRACS, QConnect and OmniOne operations are formatted and
processed at the Network Management Center in San Diego, California, which we
operate, with a fully redundant backup Network Management Center located in Las
Vegas, Nevada. Our Network Management Center operations are subject to system
failures, which could interrupt the services and have a material adverse effect
on our operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we install new or upgraded business management systems.
To the extent such systems fail or are not properly implemented, we may
experience material disruptions to our business that could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products and those of our customers and licensees are subject to
various regulations, including FCC regulations in the United States and other
international regulations, as well as the specifications of national, regional
and international standards bodies. Changes in the regulation of our
activities, including changes in the allocation of available spectrum by the
United States government and other governments or exclusion or limitation of
our technology or products by a government or standards body, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, liquidity and
financial position.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Our business and operating results will be harmed if we are unable to manage
growth in our business.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that
have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our managerial,
operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must
continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial
systems and controls, including quality control and delivery and service
capabilities. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee
base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and
production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product
introductions and product and technology transitions. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the
quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and
licensees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, inaccuracies in our demand forecasts, or failure of the
systems used to develop the forecasts, could quickly result in either
insufficient or excessive inventories and disproportionate overhead expenses.
If we ineffectively manage our growth or are unsuccessful in recruiting and
retaining personnel, our business and operating results will be harmed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our Board
members, executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.
Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel. In addition, implementing our product and
business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, and our
revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. Key
employees represent a significant asset, and the competition for these
employees is intense in the wireless communications industry. We continue to
anticipate significant increases in human resources, particularly in
engineering resources, through fiscal 2005. If we are unable to attract and
retain the qualified employees that we need, our business may be harmed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel
in periods of poor operating performance given the significant use of incentive
compensation by our competitors. We do not have employment agreements with our
key management personnel and do not maintain key person life insurance on any
of our personnel. The loss of one or more of our key employees or our inability
to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our
ability to design, develop and commercialize our products and technology.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception, we have used stock options and other long-term equity
incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We
believe that stock options and other long-term equity incentives directly
motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the
use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. To the extent
that new regulations make it less attractive to grant options to employees, we
may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy
or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which
could materially and adversely affect our business.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing

change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported
financial results or the way we conduct our business.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, any changes requiring that we record compensation expense in
the statement of operations for employee stock options using the fair value
method or changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could
have a significant negative effect on our reported results and on our ability
to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results
as a result of the variability of the factors used to establish the
value of stock options. Several agencies
and entities are considering, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB)&nbsp;has announced, proposals to change generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States that, if implemented, would require us to
record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants. This pending
requirement would negatively impact our reported earnings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public
disclosure may result in additional expenses.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance
and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC
regulations and NASDAQ National Market rules, are creating uncertainty for
companies such as ours. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards
are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of
specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over
time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which
could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher
costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and
public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws,
regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to
result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of
management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance
activities. In particular, our efforts to comply with Section&nbsp;404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required
assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external
auditors&#146; audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant
financial and managerial resources. In addition, it has become more difficult
and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance,
and we have purchased reduced coverage at substantially higher cost than in the
past. We expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of
significant resources. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and
chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in
connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have
difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive
officers, which could harm our business. If our efforts to comply with new or
changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by
regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our
reputation may be harmed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and Delaware law
could adversely affect the performance of our stock.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our certificate of incorporation provides for cumulative voting in the
election of directors. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides
for a classified board of directors and includes a provision that requires the
approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock as a condition to a
merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, a holder of
15% or more of our voting stock. This approval is not required in cases where
certain of our directors approve the transaction or where certain minimum price
criteria and other procedural requirements are met. Our certificate of
incorporation also requires the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our
voting stock to amend or change the provisions mentioned relating to the
classified board, cumulative voting or the transaction approval. Under our
bylaws, stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings of our
stockholders. Finally, our certificate of incorporation provides that any
action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected
at a duly called annual or special meeting rather than by any consent in
writing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classified board, transaction approval, special meeting and other
charter provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an
actual or potential change in our control. These provisions may also discourage
certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive
a premium for their shares over then current market prices and may limit our
stockholders&#146; ability to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their
best interests.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we have distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding
share of our common stock pursuant to the terms of our preferred share purchase
rights plan. These rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a
person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board
of Directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts. In
addition, our Board of Directors has the authority to fix the rights and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the facilities above, we also own or lease an additional
approximate 627,000 square feet of properties that are leased or subleased to
third parties. Our leases expire at varying dates through 2012 not including
renewals that would be at our option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started construction of two facilities in San Diego, California in
fiscal 2003, totaling approximately one million additional square feet, to meet
the requirements projected in our long-term business plan. We recently
announced our plans to expand our current Network Operations Center in Las
Vegas, which uses GPS and other technologies to track freight transportation
and shipping nationwide, by approximately one hundred thousand square feet. We
expect to place the new and expanded facilities in service starting in fiscal
2005 through fiscal 2007. We believe that our facilities will be suitable and
adequate for the present purposes, and that the productive capacity in such
facilities is substantially being utilized. In the future, we may need to
purchase, build or lease additional facilities to meet the requirements
projected in our long-term business plan.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;3. Legal Proceedings</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Schwartz, et al v. QUALCOMM</I>: In fiscal 2001, 87 former QUALCOMM employees
filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court for Boulder County, Colorado,
alleging claims for intentional misrepresentation, nondisclosure and
concealment, violation of C.R.S. Section&nbsp;8-2-104 (obtaining workers by
misrepresentation), breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation,
unjust enrichment, violation of California Labor Code Section&nbsp;970, violation of
California Civil Code Sections&nbsp;1709-1710, rescission, violation of California
Business &#038; Professions Code Section&nbsp;17200 and violation of California Civil
Code Section&nbsp;1575. The complaint seeks economic, emotional distress and
punitive damages and unspecified amounts of interest. On November&nbsp;29, 2001, the
Court granted our motion to dismiss 17 of the plaintiffs from the lawsuit.
Subsequently, the Court dismissed three other plaintiffs from the lawsuit. On
November&nbsp;18, 2002, the Court granted our motion to dismiss 61 of the remaining
67 plaintiffs from the lawsuit. We subsequently resolved the matters with the
remaining plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed have
appealed. Oral argument on the appeal occurred on October&nbsp;26, 2004, and no
decision has been received.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Hanig et al. v. QUALCOMM, Boesel, et al v. QUALCOMM, Stone v. QUALCOMM,
Ortiz et al v. QUALCOMM, Shannon et al. v. QUALCOMM, Deshon et al v. QUALCOMM,
Earnhart et al. v. QUALCOMM</I>: These cases, the first of which was filed in
fiscal 2001, were filed in San Diego County Superior Court by over 100 former
employees, alleging claims for declaratory relief, breach of contract,
intentional/negligent fraud, concealment, rescission, specific performance,
work, labor and services, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, violation of California Business &#038; Professions Code Section&nbsp;17200 and
unjust enrichment, claiming that they were entitled to full vesting of unvested
stock options as a result of the sale of our infrastructure business to
Ericsson in 1999. We have answered the complaints, which have been
consolidated, and discovery is ongoing. On July&nbsp;16, 2004, the Court granted our
summary adjudication motion, dismissing plaintiffs&#146; breach of contract claims.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Durante, et al v. QUALCOMM</I>: On February&nbsp;2, 2000, three former employees
filed a putative class action against us, ostensibly on behalf of themselves
and those former employees of ours whose employment was terminated in April
1999. Virtually all of the purported class of plaintiffs received severance
packages at the time of the termination of their employment, in exchange for a
release of claims, other than federal age discrimination claims, against us.
The complaint was filed in California Superior Court in and for the County of
Los Angeles and purports to state 10 causes of action including breach of
contract, age discrimination, violation of Labor Code Section&nbsp;200, violation of
Labor Code Section&nbsp;970, unfair business practices, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, unjust enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, declaratory relief and undue influence. The complaint seeks an
order accelerating all unvested stock options for the members of the class,
plus economic and liquidated damages of an unspecified amount. On June&nbsp;27,
2000, the case was ordered transferred from Los Angeles County Superior Court
to San Diego County Superior Court. On July&nbsp;3, 2000, we removed the case to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and
discovery commenced. On May&nbsp;29, 2001, the Court dismissed all plaintiffs&#146;
claims except for claims arising under the federal Age Discrimination in
Employment Act. On July&nbsp;16, 2001, the Court granted conditional class
certification on the remaining claims, to be revisited by the Court at the end
of the discovery period. On April&nbsp;15, 2003, the Court granted our summary
judgment motions as to all remaining class members&#146; disparate impact claims. On
June&nbsp;18, 2003, the Court ordered decertification of the class and dismissed the
remaining claims of the opt-in plaintiffs without prejudice. Plaintiffs have
filed an appeal. On June&nbsp;20, 2003, 76 of the opt-in plaintiffs filed an action
in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging
violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of their
layoffs in 1999. To date, the complaint has not been served.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM, Inc. and SnapTrack,
Inc.</I>: On March&nbsp;30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. (Zoltar) filed
suit against us and SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a QUALCOMM wholly-owned
subsidiary, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California seeking damages and injunctive relief and alleging infringement of
three patents. On August&nbsp;27, 2001, Zoltar filed an amended complaint adding
Sprint Corp. as a named defendant and narrowing certain infringement claims
against us and SnapTrack. Since then, Zoltar has dismissed Sprint Corp. as a
defendant. Trial of this matter commenced on February&nbsp;24, 2004. On March&nbsp;25,
2004, the jury reached a unanimous verdict of no infringement in our favor and
SnapTrack on six of the seven patent claims asserted by Zoltar. On July&nbsp;26,
2004, the Court found no infringement on the remaining patent claim asserted by
Zoltar and entered a judgment in favor of us and SnapTrack on Zoltar&#146;s
complaint and awarded us and SnapTrack our costs of suit. Zoltar has noticed an
appeal and we and SnapTrack have filed a responsive notice.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Texas Instruments Incorporated v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On July&nbsp;25, 2003,
we filed an action in Delaware Superior Court against Texas Instruments
Incorporated for breach of a patent portfolio license agreement between the
parties, seeking damages and other relief. On September&nbsp;23, 2003, Texas
Instruments filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court against us alleging
breach of the same agreement, seeking damages and other relief. We have since
dismissed our case in Superior Court and refiled our claims as part of the
action in the Chancery Court. In a written order dated July&nbsp;14, 2004, the Court
granted our summary judgment motion, dismissing all of Texas Instruments&#146;
claims against us. In addition, the Court ruled that Texas Instruments had
breached the patent portfolio license agreement, though the breach was
non-material, and therefore Texas Instruments&#146; license under the agreement
would not be forfeited. The Court held a one-day bench trial on August&nbsp;16,
2004, on our claim that Texas Instruments breached the agreement between the
parties by pursuing the claims previously dismissed by the Court. Although the
Court had already found that the claims brought by Texas Instruments were
barred by the agreement, the Court declined to find that bringing the claims
constituted a breach of the agreement by Texas Instruments and, therefore,
found against us on the sole remaining claim in the case. On October&nbsp;22, 2004,
we filed a notice of appeal.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Conexant Systems, Inc. and Skyworks Solutions
Inc.</I>: On October&nbsp;8, 2002, we filed an action in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of California against Conexant and Skyworks
alleging infringement of five patents and misappropriation of trade secrets and
seeking damages and injunctive relief. On December&nbsp;4, 2003, Skyworks answered
and counterclaimed against us, alleging infringement of four patents and
misappropriation of trade secrets and seeking damages and injunctive relief. On
April&nbsp;30, 2004, the Court granted our motion to dismiss defendants&#146; inequitable
conduct affirmative defenses and counterclaims. We filed an amended complaint
on June&nbsp;16, 2004, bringing the total number of our patents at issue to eight
and maintaining the trade secret misappropriation claim. On July&nbsp;16 and 20,
2004, Conexant and Skyworks answered our amended complaint, reasserted claims
based on alleged trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement and
Skyworks also asserted counterclaims alleging violations of antitrust laws and
unfair business practices. Conexant and Skyworks seek damages and other forms
of relief. On September&nbsp;21, 2004, we moved to stay the Skyworks antitrust and
related counterclaims. That motion is pending. We believe the counterclaims are
without merit. Claim construction hearings relating to the patents in the case
are under way. Discovery in the matter is continuing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.: </I>On December&nbsp;2,
2002, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California against Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) alleging
infringement of three patents and seeking damages and injunctive relief. We
have since amended the complaint, bringing the total number of patents at issue
to four. On May&nbsp;5, 2004, the Court granted Maxim&#146;s motion that no indirect
infringement arose in connection with defendants&#146; sales of certain products to
certain licensees of ours. On June&nbsp;21, 2004, the Court granted our motion to
stay all of Maxim&#146;s antitrust counterclaims and its patent misuse defense. On
July&nbsp;9, 2004, Maxim filed an Answer and Counterclaims to our Third Amended
Complaint. Maxim&#146;s amended counterclaims allege violation of antitrust laws and
unfair business practices and seek damages and other relief. We believe the
amended counterclaims are without merit and, if and when the Court&#146;s stay is
lifted, we will seek dismissal of those counterclaims as a matter of law. Claim
construction hearings relating to the patents in the case are under way.
Discovery in the matter is continuing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other: </I>We have been named, along with many other manufacturers of wireless
phones, wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant
in purported class action lawsuits (In re Wireless Telephone Frequency
Emissions Products Liability Litigation, United States District Court for the
District of Maryland), and in several individually filed actions, seeking
personal injury, economic and/or punitive damages arising out of our sale of
cellular phones. On March&nbsp;5, 2003, the Court granted the defendants motions to
dismiss five of the consolidated cases (Pinney, Gimpleson, Gillian, Farina and
Naquin) on the grounds that the claims were preempted by federal law. On April
2, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this order and the Court&#146;s
order denying remand. All remaining cases filed against us allege personal
injury as a result of their use of a wireless telephone. Those cases have been
remanded to the Washington, D.C. Superior Court. The courts that have reviewed
similar claims against other companies to date have held that there was
insufficient scientific basis for the plaintiffs&#146; claims in those cases.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the
foregoing matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating
results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without
merit and will vigorously defend the actions. We have not recorded any accrual
for contingent liability associated with the legal proceedings described above
based on our belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable. Further,
any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. We are engaged in
numerous other legal actions

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to continued
capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in
the best interests of the stockholders. Our dividend policy may be affected by,
among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements,
including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of
sales distribution channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks,
stock repurchase programs and challenges to our business model.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Stock Options</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stock option plans are part of a broad-based, long-term retention
program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and directors
and align stockholder and employee interests.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to our 2001 Stock Option Plan (2001 Plan), we may grant options
to selected employees, directors and consultants to purchase shares of our
common stock at a price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the
date of grant. The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding vest
over periods not exceeding six years and are exercisable for up to 10&nbsp;years
from the grant date. We also may grant options pursuant to our 2001
Non-Employee Directors&#146; Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Directors&#146; Plan). This plan
provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted to non-employee
directors at an exercise price of not less than fair market value of the stock
at the date of grant, vesting over periods not exceeding five years and
exercisable for up to 10&nbsp;years from the grant date. The Board of Directors may
terminate the 2001 Plan and/or the 2001 Directors&#146; Plan at any time though it
must, nevertheless, honor any stock options previously granted pursuant to the
plans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information regarding our stock option plans and plan activity
for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 is provided in our consolidated financial
statements. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 &#151; Employee
Benefit Plans.&#148;

    <TD>Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded royalty revenues
from certain licensees based on our estimates of royalties during the
period they were earned. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by
licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing
royalty revenue was made
prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty
revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. See Item&nbsp;7,

    <TD>Strong CDMA market growth throughout the world drove demand for
our products and the products of our licensees. Enhanced multimedia
functionality, increased growth of 1xEV-DO, local number portability
initiatives and improving competitive positioning of CDMA operators
drove worldwide growth in CDMA phone sales. Introduction of new CDMA
networks in developing regions, as well as continued growth of
networks in China and India, also contributed to growth in CDMA
sales. Worldwide, 1xEV-DO grew to over nine million subscribers in
September&nbsp;2004. During fiscal 2004, we shipped approximately 137
million Mobile Station Modem (MSM)&nbsp;integrated circuits for mobile
CDMA phones and data modules, nearly all of which were third
generation (3G), including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO and WCDMA.</TD>

    <TD>By calendar year end 2004, operators are expected to have
launched 70 WCDMA networks as reported by GSMA (GSM Association).
WCDMA subscriber growth in Japan and Europe, and new network launches
in Europe and Asia drove growth in WCDMA phone sales during fiscal
2004. Thirteen subscriber licensees and eleven infrastructure
licensees reported sales of WCDMA products in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004. WCDMA royalties grew from 12% of royalties reported in
the first fiscal quarter of 2004 for licensee sales during the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2003 to 26% of royalties reported in the fourth
fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004 for licensee sales during the third
fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004. Currently, average WCDMA phone prices
are significantly higher than worldwide average CDMA2000 phone
prices. During fiscal 2004, several leading manufacturers announced
the selection of our WCDMA MSM integrated circuits for their WCDMA
phone products, including Siemens, Samsung, LG Electronics, Sanyo and
Option.</TD>

    <TD>As a result of record demand for CDMA products, our integrated
circuits business continued to experience supply constraints which
resulted in our inability to meet certain customer demands. To enable
better supply of integrated circuit products, we have increased and
extended firm orders to our foundry suppliers and are working with
them to increase capacity. We are also evaluating potential new

    <TD>In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due
to the global growth of WCDMA networks and the increasing variability
of our licensees&#146; market shares due to greater global competition, we
would begin to recognize royalty revenues solely based on royalties
reported by licensees during the quarter, rather than continuing to
estimate royalty revenues earned from certain licensees in advance of
receiving their royalty reports. Accordingly, we did not estimate
royalty revenues earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and
royalties recorded as revenue for fiscal 2004 do not reflect an
entire year&#146;s worth of royalties (some royalties reported in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004 were recorded based on estimates as
revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003).</TD>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Our Business and Operating Segments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We design, manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications
products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We
derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from
license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, from services
and related hardware sales and from software development and related services.
Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services,
research and development, selling, general and administrative,
amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, asset impairment charges
and other expenses.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct business through four operating segments. These segments are:
QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, or QCT; QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, or QTL;
QUALCOMM Wireless &#038; Internet, or QWI; and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, or
QSI.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system
software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and
global positioning. QCT&#146;s integrated circuit products and software are used in
wireless phones and infrastructure equipment. The wireless phone integrated
circuits include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF)&nbsp;and Power
Management (PM)&nbsp;devices. The wireless phone integrated circuits and software
perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning
functions, radio conversion between radio and baseband signals and power
management. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits provide the core
baseband CDMA modem functionality in the operator&#146;s equipment. QCT software
products are the operating systems that control the phone and the functionality
imbedded in our integrated circuit products. QCT revenues comprised 63% of
total consolidated revenues in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 and 54% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property
portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in
the manufacture and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne,
CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. QTL receives license
fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of
products incorporating our intellectual property. QTL revenues comprised 27%,
26% and 29% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI, which includes QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), QUALCOMM
Internet Services (QIS)&nbsp;and QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV), generates
revenue primarily through mobile communication products and services, software
and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless
applications. QWBS provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data
messaging and position reporting services to transportation companies, private
fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. QIS
provides the BREW product and services for the development and over-the-air
deployment of data services on wireless devices. QIS also provides QChat and
QPoint products and services. QChat enables virtually instantaneous
push-to-chat functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices while QPoint enables
operators to offer E-911 and location-based applications and services. The QGOV
division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise to United
States government agencies involving wireless communications technologies. The
QGOV division included the former Digital Cinema business prior to June&nbsp;2004.
In June&nbsp;2004, we were notified that a competing digital cinema compression
technology was selected by the motion picture studio consortium tasked with
technology selection for digital cinema applications. As such, we are no longer
pursuing the Digital Cinema business. Revenues from the Digital Cinema business
were $1&nbsp;million, $9&nbsp;million and $14&nbsp;million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. QWI revenues comprised 12%, 13% and 16% of total consolidated
revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSI makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA
products and services for wireless voice and Internet data communications. Our
strategy is to invest in CDMA operators, licensed device manufacturers and
start-up companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology,
support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess
unique capabilities or technology to promote Internet data communications.
Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, we expect to present the
operating results of our wireless multimedia U.S. operator in the QSI segment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Looking Forward</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 2005, we expect continued growth in the overall CDMA2000
and WCDMA market, with particularly strong growth in WCDMA and emerging
CDMA2000 markets. We expect continued growth in 1xEV-DO in South Korea, Japan
and Latin America, as well as North America, with expected launches of
nationwide service by both Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS. The global
expansion of broadband data services is expected to continue to drive demand
for both 1xEV-DO phones and data cards for laptop services. Operator
competition in Japan, North America and other regions is also accelerating data
strategies and services as one operator responds to the plans of another. As
reported by mobilemonday.net, a community of and for mobile professionals,
operators are expected to have launched 70 WCDMA networks by the end of
calendar 2004, which is expected to drive meaningful growth in WCDMA phone
sales during fiscal year 2005. Cingular Wireless in North America is looking
to launch WCDMA/HSDPA later in 2005. We anticipate 3G wireless licenses
will be granted in China in calendar 2005. When the licenses are granted, we
expect operators in China will be authorized to upgrade and deploy third

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">generation CDMA-based networks. We also expect additional CDMA450 network
launches in fiscal 2005 to contribute to growth. We believe our QCT business
will increasingly benefit from strong growth in the WCDMA market as we leverage
our high quality products and customer relationships to further a strong and
growing list of WCDMA phone manufacturer customers.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing demand for phones and devices with greater multimedia
functionality will continue to drive demand for increasing functionality in our
MSM chips. We will continue to invest heavily to position our QCT business for
success in the WCDMA market, as well as to continue to maintain our strong
position in the CDMA2000 market. In particular, we intend to continue to invest
significant resources in developing integrated circuit products to support
high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork
operation including CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, FLO, OFDM and multimedia
applications which encompass development of graphical display, camera and video
capabilities, as well as higher computational capability and lower power on -
chip computers and signal processors. We continue to work on different
initiatives for low-cost phones in addition to reducing costs through further
integration of multimedia capabilities of mid- to high-end phones. We will also
continue our significant development efforts with respect to our BREW
applications development platform and our new MediaFLO content distribution
system and FLO technology for delivery of low cost multimedia content to
multiple subscribers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working closely with many operators and manufacturers to support
rapid and reliable WCDMA deployment and availability of WCDMA phones (with
increasing multimedia features and capabilities). We expect that in 2005
average WCDMA phone prices will decrease significantly, although we
expect them to still be higher
than average CDMA2000 phone prices.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BREW is expected to play an increasingly important role in generating
consumer demand for wireless phones. BREW offers operators new capabilities for
their products and an open platform for delivery of data services that can grow
operator&#146;s data revenues. We expect more operators to launch BREW services and
greater volumes of BREW software downloads to drive increasing revenues for our
BREW business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have taken action to mitigate shortages of integrated circuits
that we supply, the effects of such shortages have caused some customer
frustration and could negatively affect our future business. We expect that the
costs of certain integrated circuit products could increase as a result of our
efforts to increase the availability of products in short supply. While we work
closely with customers to expedite their processes for evaluating products from
our new foundry suppliers, in some instances, transition to new product supply
may cause a temporary decline in shipments of specific products to individual
customers. As a result of our efforts to increase capacity at our current
suppliers combined with the potential to bring on additional suppliers, we
expect our shortages of integrated circuits to be alleviated in the future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dependent upon the adoption and commercial deployment of 3G
wireless communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA
technology to increase our revenues and market share. We continue to face
significant competition from non-CDMA technologies, as well as competition from
companies offering other CDMA based products. You should also refer to the Risk
Factors included in this Annual Report for further discussion of these and
other risks related to our business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue Concentrations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from customers in South Korea, the United States and Japan
comprised 43%, 21% and 18%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues in
fiscal 2004 as compared to 45%, 23% and 15%, respectively, in fiscal 2003, and
39%, 31% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2002. We distinguish revenue from
external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. The increase
in revenues from customers in Japan, as a percentage of the total, is primarily
attributed to higher royalties from licensees in Japan resulting from the
growth of CDMA2000 and WCDMA in Japan as well as their success in exporting
products worldwide. The decrease in revenues from customers in the United
States, as a percentage of the total, is primarily attributed to overall
increases in revenues in geographic regions other than the United States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and
capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of
contingent


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">42
</DIV>

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always"><A HREF="#tocpage">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition,
valuation of intangible assets and investments, income taxes, and litigation.
We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on
various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature,
estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that
differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our
operating results and financial position. We believe that the following
significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of
judgment and complexity than others.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>We derive revenue principally from sales of
integrated circuit products, from royalties for our intellectual property, from
messaging and other services and related hardware sales, from software
development and related services, and from license fees for intellectual
property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually
recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the
specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and
obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized
involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but it is
possible that actual results may differ from our estimates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio,
which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the
manufacture and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne, CDMA2000
1X/1x EV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. We recognized royalty
revenue as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made for
certain licensees through the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Starting in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recognize revenues solely when royalties are
reported to us by our licensees as we no longer have the ability to
reliably estimate these amounts. The change in the timing of
recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively
and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 due to the fact that no estimated royalty
revenues were recorded in that quarter. As a result of this change, we believe
that the estimates and assumptions used in applying our revenue recognition
policies with respect to the timing and amount of recording our royalty
revenues will have a less material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. </I></B>Our business acquisitions
typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded
values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of September&nbsp;30,
2004, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were
$356&nbsp;million and $128&nbsp;million, respectively. The determination of the value of
such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential
impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and
future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational
performance of our acquired businesses, market conditions and other factors.
Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the
estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning. If
these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be
required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and
intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future
impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our
reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with
our acquired businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have
an adverse impact on our results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold minority strategic investments in publicly-traded companies whose
share prices may be highly volatile. These investments totaled $150&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;30, 2004. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment
has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that
a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value
of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the
future. When assessing a publicly-traded investment for an other-than-temporary
decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how
significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how
long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost,
the performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in relation to the stock price of
its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst
recommendations. We also review the financial statements of the
investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial
difficulties. In the event our judgments change as to


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">43

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">other-than-temporary
declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse
impact on our results of operations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values
are difficult to determine. These investments totaled $163&nbsp;million at September
30, 2004. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has
experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a
decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value
of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the
future. When assessing investments in private companies for an
other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other
things, the share price from the investee&#146;s latest financing round, the
performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its
business plan, the investee&#146;s revenue and cost trends, the liquidity and cash
position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee&#146;s
products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party
evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. We also
consider new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming, any
significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the
investee&#146;s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry
in which the investee operates. In the event our judgments change as to
other-than temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which
could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>Our income tax provision is based on calculations and
assumptions that will be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these
examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in
determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Should the actual
results differ from our estimates, we would have to adjust the income tax
provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known. Such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of
operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability
and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income,
projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning
strategies. As of September&nbsp;30, 2004, gross deferred tax assets were $1.1
billion. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income
in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the actual
effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary
differences become taxable or deductible, the Company could be required to
increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets which could
result in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on
operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company has recorded gross deferred tax
assets of $418&nbsp;million related to capital loss carry forwards. We can only use
capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our assessments of projected
future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we expect
that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital
losses that we have incurred through fiscal 2004. Therefore, we have provided a
valuation allowance in the amount of $139&nbsp;million for the portion of capital
losses we do not expect to utilize. Adjustments to our valuation allowance
based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are
reflected in the period the change is made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for
United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future
remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative
amount of which is approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion as of September&nbsp;30, 2004. Should
we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax
provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign
subsidiaries is made. We are currently studying the impact of the one-time
favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate future earnings of some
of our foreign subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Litigation. </I></B>We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings.
Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these
matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating
results, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the
range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of
loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is
considered probable. Where a liability is
probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in
the range, we record the minimum estimated


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">44

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">liability related to the claim. As
additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability
related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. The Company has not
recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with the Company&#146;s
legal proceedings based on the Company&#146;s belief that a liability, while
possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be
estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability
could materially impact our results of operations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Licensing</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We grant licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio,
which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the
manufacture, use and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne,
CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. Licensees typically
pay a nonrefundable license fee in one or more installments and ongoing
royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed
intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of
future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn
royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees at the
time that the licensees&#146; sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and
pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of
that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported
quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis. During periods preceding the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues
earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter
in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such
amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were estimated. Royalties for
licensees for which we had minimal reporting history and certain licensees that
did not incorporate our integrated circuit products into their own products
were recorded one quarter in arrears, i.e. in the quarter in which the
royalties were reported to us by those licensees. Estimates of royalty revenues
for the Estimated Licensees were based on analyses of our sales of integrated
circuits to Estimated Licensees, historical royalty data for Estimated
Licensees, an estimate of the time between our sales of integrated circuits to
Estimated Licensees and Estimated Licensees&#146; sales of CDMA products, average
sales price forecasts, estimates of inventory levels and current market and
economic trends. Once royalty reports were received from the Estimated
Licensees, the variance between such reports and the estimate was recorded as
royalty revenue in the quarter in which the reports were received, i.e. in most
cases, the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which the estimated royalties
were recorded as revenue.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to
recent escalating business trends, we no longer have the ability to reliably
estimate royalty revenues from certain licensees. These escalating trends
include the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes
in market share among licensees due to increased global competition and
increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product
inventories of licensees. Accordingly, we did not estimate royalty revenues
earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Starting in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we began recognizing revenues solely based on royalties reported
by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of
recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively
and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalties reported by our
licensees were $151&nbsp;million higher than royalty revenues from external
licensees recorded in fiscal 2004 because $151&nbsp;million in royalties that were
reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 had been estimated and recorded as
revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. To facilitate an understanding of
the impact of the change, the following table compares royalty revenues
recorded as revenue in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 to royalties reported by our
licensees during those same periods (in millions):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">* Recorded as revenue in the prior year, but reported by
licensees during the current year.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table above illustrates that the difference between royalties reported
by external licensees and royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in
our consolidated statements of operations has equaled the difference between
the estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the current year and the
estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the prior year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Strategic Investments in our QSI Segment</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our QSI segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide
adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and Internet data
communications. QSI segment assets totaled $400&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;30, 2004, compared to $839&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;30, 2003. In general, we enter into strategic relationships with CDMA
wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for
the wireless communications industry. Due to financial and competitive
challenges facing CDMA wireless operators, we cannot assure you that our
investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial returns or
that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of CDMA
technologies. CDMA wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have
limited operating histories, are faced with significant capital requirements
and are highly leveraged and/or have limited financial resources. If these CDMA
wireless operators are not successful, we may have to write down our
investments in or loans to these operators.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our QSI segment maintains strategic holdings of various issuers and types.
These securities include available-for-sale equity securities and derivative
instruments that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. We
strategically invest in companies in the high-technology industry and typically
do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these
investments. Available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments
recorded at fair value subject us to equity price risk. The fair values of
these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual
fluctuations and to significant market price volatility. Our strategic
investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and
changes in concentrations may affect price volatility. In general, our
investments in available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments
suffered significant decreases in market value during the last three years.
Downward fluctuations and market trends could further adversely affect our
operating results. In addition, the realizable value of these securities and
derivative instruments is subject to market and other conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSI also makes strategic investments in privately held companies,
including early stage companies and venture funds. These investments are
recorded at cost or under the equity method, but the recorded values may be
written down due to changes in the companies&#146; conditions or prospects. These
strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies
or products the investees are developing may never materialize. As a result, we
could lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies, which could
negatively affect our financial position and operating results. Most of these
strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the
date of investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become liquid and
meet strategic and price objectives, we may sell the investments and recognize
the realized gain (loss)&nbsp;in investment income (expense).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments
in both marketable and private securities. If events and circumstances indicate
that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than
temporary, we will record a charge to investment income (expense). During
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the QSI segment recognized $12&nbsp;million, $127
million and $221&nbsp;million, respectively, in charges related to other-than-
temporary losses on marketable and private securities. In some cases, we
make strategic investments that require us

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">to consolidate or record our equity
in the losses of early stage companies. The consolidation of these losses can
adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our
exposure to the investments.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may accept an equity interest in a licensee as
consideration for a portion or all of the license fee payable under our CDMA
license agreement. QTL records license fee revenue based on the fair value of
the equity instruments received, if determinable. The measurement date for
determination of fair value is the earlier of the date at which a performance
commitment is made or the date at which the performance is complete. The
evaluation procedures used to determine fair value include, but are not limited
to, examining the current market price for the shares if the licensee is
publicly traded, examining recent rounds of financing and the licensee&#146;s
business plan if not publicly traded, and performing other due diligence
procedures. This equity program does not affect the licensees&#146; obligations to
pay royalties under their CDMA license agreements. The amount of cash
consideration and the timing of revenue recognition vary depending on the terms
of each agreement. As of September&nbsp;30, 2004, ten licensees have participated in
this program. We recognized $5&nbsp;million of revenue in each of fiscal 2004 and
2003 and $6&nbsp;million of revenue in fiscal 2002 related to equity received as
license fees. The equity investments received from this program are assets of
QSI.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal 2004 included
the sale of the V&#233;sper Operating Companies and related assets which are
presented as discontinued operations, our receipt from Pegaso of prepayment of
our $193&nbsp;million loan facility, and ongoing investment in Inquam.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Discontinued Operations in our QSI Segment</I></B><B>. </B>In fiscal 1999, we acquired
ownership interests in two companies in Brazil, V&#233;sper S&#227;o Paulo S.A. and
V&#233;sper S.A. (the V&#233;sper Operating Companies). In November&nbsp;2001, we consummated
a series of transactions resulting in an overall financial restructuring of the
V&#233;sper Operating Companies, which resulted in our holding direct and indirect
controlling ownership interests in the V&#233;sper Operating Companies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;2, 2003 (the Closing Date), Embratel Participa&#231;&#245;es S.A.
(Embratel) acquired our direct and indirect ownership interests in the V&#233;sper
Operating Companies (the Embratel sale transaction) for no consideration. The
V&#233;sper Operating Companies&#146; existing communication towers and related interests
in tower site property leases (V&#233;sper Towers) were not included in the Embratel
sale transaction, and as such, we effectively retained, through a new
wholly-owned subsidiary (TowerCo), ownership and control of the V&#233;sper Towers.
The V&#233;sper Towers had a net book value of approximately $5&nbsp;million at December
28, 2003. Concurrent with the closing, the V&#233;sper Operating Companies entered
into a 10-year agreement (renewable at the V&#233;sper Operating Companies&#146; option
for up to two successive 5-year terms) whereby the V&#233;sper Operating Companies
would pay a monthly fee to us for use of aerial and ground space on the tower
sites. We provided approximately $6&nbsp;million to fund operations of the V&#233;sper
Operating Companies during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 prior to their sale
and additionally provided approximately $39&nbsp;million in aggregate funding to or
for the benefit of the V&#233;sper Operating Companies on or before the Closing Date
to facilitate the Embratel sale transaction. Such funding enabled the V&#233;sper
Operating Companies to completely extinguish their existing local bank debt (at
an agreed discount) to allow us to retain ownership of the V&#233;sper Towers free
and clear of any local bank security interest. The major classes of assets and
liabilities sold in the Embratel sale transaction included: $25&nbsp;million in
accounts receivable, $5&nbsp;million in inventory, $24&nbsp;million in other current
assets, $95&nbsp;million in property, plant and equipment, $6&nbsp;million in other
assets, $52&nbsp;million in accounts payable, $5&nbsp;million in payroll and other
benefits related liabilities, $6&nbsp;million in unearned revenue, $1&nbsp;million in
other current liabilities, $14&nbsp;million in long-term debt and $3&nbsp;million in
other liabilities. We realized a net loss of $52&nbsp;million on the Embratel sale
transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, including a $74&nbsp;million
loss on the net assets sold to Embratel and a $46&nbsp;million loss related to the
recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously
included in stockholders&#146; equity, partially offset by $68&nbsp;million in gains
related to the extinguishment of local bank debt and the settlement of other
liabilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;19, 2002, we won bids to acquire personal mobile service (SMP)
licenses in certain regions of Brazil. Approximately $8&nbsp;million of the
approximate $82&nbsp;million purchase price for the SMP licenses was paid in
December&nbsp;2002. The remaining Brazilian real-denominated obligation was financed
by the Brazilian government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an
adjustment for inflation. These SMP licenses were not included in the Embratel
sale transaction. In December&nbsp;2003, we initiated a waiver and return of the SMP
licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. In
February&nbsp;2004, the waiver and return of the SMP licenses was approved by
Anatel, and the license debt was extinguished. We realized a net gain of $19
million as a result of the removal of the $104&nbsp;million SMP licenses and the related $123&nbsp;million debt
and accrued interest during the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;2, 2004, we sold TowerCo to Embratel in a separately negotiated
transaction (the TowerCo sale transaction) for $45&nbsp;million in cash. TowerCo&#146;s
assets were primarily comprised of $5&nbsp;million in property, plant and equipment.
We realized a net gain of $40&nbsp;million on the TowerCo sale transaction during
the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result of the disposition of the
remaining operations and assets related to the V&#233;sper Operating Companies, we
determined that the results of operations and cash flows related to the V&#233;sper
Operating Companies, including the results related to TowerCo and the SMP
licenses and the gains and losses realized on the Embratel and TowerCo sales
transactions, should be presented as discontinued operations in our
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Our statements of
operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present
the discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, revenues of $36&nbsp;million, $123&nbsp;million and
$125&nbsp;million, respectively, were reported in the loss from discontinued
operations. At September&nbsp;30, 2004, we had no remaining assets or liabilities
related to the V&#233;sper Operating Companies, TowerCo or the SMP licenses recorded
on our consolidated balance sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Prepayment of the Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. Loan Facility.</I></B>
We had various financing arrangements, including a bridge loan facility, an
equipment loan facility, interim and additional interim loan facilities, with
Pegaso Comunicaciones y Sistemas S.A. de C.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V., a CDMA wireless operator in Mexico
(collectively referred to as Pegaso). On September&nbsp;10, 2002, Telef&#243;nica M&#243;viles
(Telef&#243;nica) acquired a 65% controlling interest in Pegaso. On October&nbsp;10,
2002, Pegaso paid $82&nbsp;million in full satisfaction of the interim and
additional interim loans. On November&nbsp;8, 2002, Pegaso paid $435&nbsp;million in full
satisfaction of the bridge loan facility. We used approximately $139&nbsp;million of
the bridge loan proceeds to purchase outstanding vendor debt owed by Pegaso to
other lenders. On June&nbsp;13, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $281&nbsp;million of the equipment
loan facility, including accrued interest, in accordance with certain terms of
the equipment loan facility. On December&nbsp;15, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $193&nbsp;million,
including accrued interest, in full satisfaction of the equipment loan
facility. We recognized $12&nbsp;million, $41&nbsp;million and $9&nbsp;million in interest
income related to the Pegaso financing arrangements during fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, including $10&nbsp;million and $23&nbsp;million of deferred
interest income recorded as a result of the prepayments in fiscal 2004 and
2003, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Investment in Inquam Limited. </I></B>We have invested $200&nbsp;million in the
convertible preferred shares of Inquam Limited (Inquam) for an approximate 42%
ownership interest in Inquam. Inquam owns, develops and manages wireless
communications systems, either directly or indirectly, with the intent of
deploying CDMA-based technology, primarily in Europe. Starting in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003, we and another investor (the Other Investor) also
extended $117&nbsp;million in bridge loan financings to Inquam, including $31
million in bridge loan funding put in place during fiscal 2004. We funded our
approximate $58&nbsp;million share of these bridge loans and had no remaining
funding commitment at September&nbsp;30, 2004. Inquam is a variable interest entity.
We do not consolidate Inquam because we are not the primary beneficiary. We use
the equity method to account for our investment in Inquam. We recorded $59
million, $99&nbsp;million and $45&nbsp;million in equity in losses of Inquam during
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At September&nbsp;30, 2004, our equity and
debt investments in Inquam totaled $42&nbsp;million, net of equity in losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;22, 2003, we agreed, along with the Other Investor, to
guarantee the payment of amounts due by Inquam under a bank credit agreement.
During fiscal 2004, we and the Other Investor agreed to extend the guarantee
and increase the maximum amount subject to the guarantee to $55&nbsp;million. Our
maximum liability under the guarantee is limited to an amount equal to 50% of
the amounts outstanding under Inquam&#146;s credit agreement, up to a maximum of
approximately $28&nbsp;million. Amounts outstanding under the bank credit agreement
totaled $53&nbsp;million as of September&nbsp;30, 2004. The guarantee expires on November
30, 2004 when the bank credit facility matures. Inquam is currently working
with the bank and other potential lenders to secure long-term &#147;take out&#148;
financing to repay the existing loan on the maturity date. It is possible that
we and the Other Investor may provide additional guarantees in connection with
such take out financing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we and the Other Investor
committed to fund an additional $2&nbsp;million each. While we have no other
obligations to provide funding to Inquam, we continue to have active
discussions with Inquam and the Other Investor concerning the necessary funding
for all or a part of Inquam&#146;s business plan, potential
restructuring and investment by other parties. While we may provide some
additional funding and/or credit support in furtherance of Inquam&#146;s business
plan, the amount and form of such support is unknown, and none will be provided
without commensurate support or consideration being provided by the Other
Investor. If Inquam or its

investment in Inquam may be negatively affected.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenues. </I></B>Total revenues for fiscal 2004 were $4,880&nbsp;million, compared to
$3,847&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics and
Motorola, customers of our QCT and QTL segments, comprised an aggregate of 15%,
15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2004,
compared to 17%, 13% and 13% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in
fiscal 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2004 were $3,514
million, compared to $2,862&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. Revenues from sales of
integrated circuits increased $652&nbsp;million, resulting primarily from an
increase of $994&nbsp;million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and
accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $331
million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and
changes in product mix.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2004 were $1,366
million, compared to $985&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. The increase resulted
primarily from higher QTL segment royalties, resulting primarily from an
increase in phone and infrastructure equipment sales by our licensees at higher
average selling prices, partially offset by the effect of the change
in timing of recognizing royalties to an &#147;as reported&#148; method during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151&nbsp;million of
royalties that were reported by licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004,
but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
Royalties reported to us by licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1,292&nbsp;million as
compared to $837&nbsp;million in fiscal 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues
for fiscal 2004 was $1,484&nbsp;million, compared to $1,268&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003.
Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and
services revenues was 42% for fiscal 2004, compared to 44% for fiscal 2003. The
margin percentage improvement in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was
primarily due to the increase in QCT revenues as a percentage of total
equipment and services revenues, resulting in increased QCT margin relative to
the total. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment
and services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of
products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product
introduction costs and other factors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2004, research and
development expenses were $720&nbsp;million or 15% of revenues, compared to $523
million or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2003. The dollar and percentage increases
in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $187&nbsp;million
increase in costs related to integrated circuit products and other initiatives
to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and
multimode, multiband, multinetwork products, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WCDMA,
MediaFLO and HSDPA.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2004, selling,
general and administrative expenses were $568&nbsp;million or 12% of revenues,
compared to $471&nbsp;million or 12% of revenues for fiscal 2003. The dollar
increase was primarily due to a $61&nbsp;million increase in employee-related
expenses, a $21&nbsp;million increase in professional fees, primarily patent
administration and other legal costs, and outside services, and a $12&nbsp;million
increase related to a charitable grant to an educational institution for the
primary purpose of furthering the study of engineering and math.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Asset Impairment and Related Charges. </I></B>There were no asset impairment
charges in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003, we recorded a $34&nbsp;million
impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that
affected potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The
impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets&#146; carrying
values and their estimated fair values.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Other Operating Income. </I></B>For fiscal 2004, other operating income was $26
million, compared to $30&nbsp;million in fiscal 2003. Other operating income during
fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from the transfers of portions of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC)&nbsp;auction discount voucher&#146;s value (ADV)&nbsp;to a
wireless operator. Other operating income during fiscal 2003 resulted from $47
million of other income related to the transfer of portions of
the FCC auction discount voucher&#146;s value to two wireless operators, offset
by a $16&nbsp;million charge related to the write down of notes receivable from an
early stage CDMA wireless operator and an early stage media company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in interest income on cash and marketable securities held by
corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable
securities balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates
earned on these balances, and $6&nbsp;million in interest income recorded as a
result of a refund from the United States Internal Revenue Service. The
decrease in QSI interest income was primarily the result of the prepayment on
the Pegaso debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities during fiscal 2003
primarily related to an $81&nbsp;million impairment of our investment in a wireless
operator in South Korea and a $16&nbsp;million impairment of our investment in a
provider of semiconductor packaging, test and distribution services. The
other-than-temporary losses on other investments during fiscal 2003 related to
the impairment of our investments in two development stage CDMA wireless
operators. Equity in losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease
in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $59&nbsp;million for fiscal
2004 as compared to $99&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Tax Expense. </I></B>Income tax expense from continuing operations was $588
million for fiscal 2004, compared to $536&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. The annual
effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 25% for fiscal
2004, compared to 34% for fiscal 2003. The annual effective tax rate for
continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was lower than the 2003 effective tax
rate for continuing operations primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal tax rate, an increase in tax benefits
recorded arising from the forecast of our ability to use capital loss
carryforwards and the reduction of QTL earnings, which are taxed at a
rate that is lower than our effective tax rate, as a percentage of
total earnings due to the change
in the timing of recognizing QTL royalties. Foreign earnings taxed at less than the United
States federal rate are higher in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the adjustment
of an intercompany royalty agreement and an increase in foreign earnings. The
annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2004 is 10%
lower than the United States federal statutory rate due primarily to a benefit
of approximately 14% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United
States federal rate, research and development tax credits and the forecast of
our increased ability to use capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by
state taxes of 4%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;30, 2004, we had a valuation allowance of $139&nbsp;million on
previously incurred capital losses due to uncertainty as to our ability to
generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses. We will
continue to assess the realizability of capital losses. The amount of the
valuation allowance on capital losses may be adjusted in the future as our
ability to utilize capital losses changes. A change in the valuation allowance
may impact the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs. We
are currently considering actions that may result in
our ability to utilize some of the capital loss currently reserved, which
may result in a reduction of our valuation allowance and income tax expense in
subsequent periods.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenues. </I></B>Total revenues for fiscal 2003 were $3,847&nbsp;million, compared to
$2,915&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics, Motorola
and Kyocera, customers of our QCT, QTL and other nonreportable segments,
comprised an aggregate of 17%, 13%, 13% and 9% of total consolidated revenues,
respectively, in fiscal 2003, compared to 16%, 12%, 8% and 14% of total
consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2002. The percentages for
Kyocera included 1% and 4% in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to
services provided to Kyocera by employees from our terrestrial-based CDMA
wireless consumer phone business which was sold to Kyocera in February&nbsp;2000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2003 were $2,862
million, compared to $2,080&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. Revenues from sales of
integrated circuits increased by $828&nbsp;million, primarily due to an increase in
unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2003 were $985
million, compared to $835&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. The increase resulted from
higher QTL segment royalties, resulting from an increase in phone sales by our
licensees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues
for fiscal 2003 was $1,268&nbsp;million, compared to $954&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002.
Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and
services revenues was 44% for fiscal 2003, compared to 46% for fiscal 2002. The
margin percentage improvement in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was
primarily due to the increase in QCT revenues as a percentage of total
equipment and services revenues, resulting in increased QCT margin relative to
the total.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2003, research and
development expenses were $523&nbsp;million or 14% of revenues, compared to $452
million or 16% of revenues for fiscal 2002. The dollar increase in research and
development expenses was primarily due to an $84&nbsp;million increase in costs
primarily related to increased engineering resources for integrated circuit
products and other initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed
wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products,
including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WLAN, WCDMA and radioOne
technologies, partially offset by an $11&nbsp;million reduction in research and
development efforts supporting the QGOV division of the QWI segment and a $3
million reduction of support efforts related to the Globalstar business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2003, selling,
general and administrative expenses were $471&nbsp;million or 12% of revenues,
compared to $401&nbsp;million or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2002. The dollar
increase was primarily due to a $27&nbsp;million increase in employee-related
expenses, a $12&nbsp;million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $6
million increase in professional fees, primarily patent administration and
outside services, and a $6&nbsp;million increase related to international marketing
and support efforts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Amortization of Goodwill and Other Acquisition Related Intangible Assets.</I></B>
For fiscal 2003, amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related
intangible assets was $8&nbsp;million, compared to $259&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002.
Starting in fiscal 2003, we no longer record goodwill amortization as a result
of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142.
Amortization charges were primarily related to the acquisition of SnapTrack in
March&nbsp;2000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Asset Impairment and Related Charges. </I></B>For fiscal 2003, asset impairment
and related charges were $34&nbsp;million, compared to less than $1&nbsp;million of such
charges in fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, we recorded a $34&nbsp;million
impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that
affected potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The
impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets&#146; carrying
values and their estimated fair values.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Other Operating Income. </I></B>For fiscal 2003, other operating income was $30
million, compared to other operating expense of $9&nbsp;million in fiscal 2002.
Other operating income during fiscal 2003 resulted from $47&nbsp;million of other
income related to the transfer of portions of the FCC auction discount
voucher&#146;s value to two wireless operators, offset by a $16&nbsp;million charge
related to the write down of notes receivable from an early stage CDMA wireless
operator and an early stage media company. Other operating expenses during
fiscal 2002 resulted from the write down of a note receivable from an early
stage CDMA wireless operator.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in interest income on corporate cash and marketable
securities was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities
balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on
these balances. The increase in QSI interest income was primarily the result of
$23&nbsp;million of deferred interest income recorded as a result of a prepayment on
Pegaso debt facilities in fiscal 2003. The net realized gains on investments
during fiscal 2003 primarily related to the sale of a portion of our investment
in United Online. The other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities
during fiscal 2003 primarily related to an $81&nbsp;million impairment of our
investment in a wireless operator in South Korea and a $16&nbsp;million impairment
of our investment in a provider of semiconductor packaging, test and
distribution services. The other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities
during fiscal 2002 primarily related to $162&nbsp;million and $18&nbsp;million in losses
on our investments in Leap Wireless bonds and common stock, respectively. The
losses on derivative instruments during fiscal 2002 primarily resulted from
movements in the price of Leap Wireless common stock, which affected the fair
values of our warrants to acquire Leap Wireless stock. Equity in losses of
investees primarily increased due to an increase in losses incurred by Inquam,
of which our share was $99&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003 as compared to $45&nbsp;million
for fiscal 2002.

<B><I>Income Tax Expense. </I></B>Income tax expense from continuing operations was $536
million for fiscal 2003, compared to $97&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. The annual
effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately 34% for fiscal
2003, compared to a rate of 16% for fiscal 2002. The annual effective tax rate
for continuing operations for fiscal 2003 was lower than the combined federal
and state statutory tax rate of approximately 39%, primarily due to foreign earnings that were taxed at less than the
United States federal rate. The reduction was partially offset by capital losses for which we had not recorded a tax benefit. The fiscal 2003
effective tax rate for continuing operations was higher than the fiscal 2002
effective tax rate for continuing operations primarily due to the reduction of
valuation allowances in fiscal 2002 that were previously charged to income tax
expense, partially offset by the amortization of non-deductible goodwill in
fiscal 2002.

2004, compared to approximately 99&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1,043&nbsp;million, compared
to $797&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. QCT&#146;s operating income as a percentage of its
revenues (operating margin percentage) was 34% in fiscal 2004, compared to 33%
in fiscal 2003. The operating margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003 increased slightly primarily as a result of the increase in gross
margin percentage, partially offset by a 40% increase in research and
development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and
development and selling, general and administrative expenses were $154&nbsp;million
higher and $54&nbsp;million higher, respectively, for fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003 primarily associated with increased investment in new integrated
circuit products and technology research, development and marketing initiatives
to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and
multiband, multimode, multinetwork products including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WCDMA
and HSDPA.

$1,141&nbsp;million in fiscal 2004, compared to $838&nbsp;million in fiscal 2003. Royalty
revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151&nbsp;million of royalties that were
reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and
recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to
us by external licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1,292&nbsp;million, as compared to $837&nbsp;million
in fiscal 2003. Revenues from license fees were $59&nbsp;million in both fiscal 2004
and 2003. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. During each
of fiscal 2004 and 2003, we recognized $5&nbsp;million in revenue related to equity
received as license fees.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for fiscal 2003, we estimated royalties of $151&nbsp;million from
the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The actual
royalties reported to us by the Estimated Licensees, on a one quarter lag
basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $208&nbsp;million. The variance
of $57&nbsp;million recorded in royalty revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2004
was primarily attributable to greater phone sales at higher average prices by
our Estimated Licensees than we had anticipated. To achieve these phone unit
volumes, we believe that our Estimated Licensees reduced their integrated
circuit inventories in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Total royalty
revenues from licensees for fiscal 2004 of $1,141&nbsp;million included: 1) the
prior year fourth quarter variance of $57&nbsp;million and 2) other royalties
reported by licensees during fiscal 2004 of $1,084&nbsp;million. We did not estimate
royalty revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as we no
longer believe that we have the ability to reliably estimate such
amounts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QTL&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1,195&nbsp;million, compared
to $897&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. QTL&#146;s operating margin percentage was 90% in
fiscal 2004, compared to 89% in fiscal 2003. The increase in both revenues and
earnings before taxes was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA
products by licensees, resulting from higher demand for CDMA products across
all major regions of CDMA deployment at higher average selling prices,
partially offset by the change in our ability to estimate royalties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QWI Segment. </I></B>QWI revenues for fiscal 2004 were $596&nbsp;million, compared to
$511&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to a $58&nbsp;million
increase in QWBS revenue and a $37&nbsp;million increase in QIS
revenue. As a result of the adoption of EITF No.&nbsp;00-21 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, QWBS started recording

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">revenue for certain equipment
sales upon shipment instead of amortizing the related revenue over a future
period. The amortization of QWBS equipment revenue that was deferred in the
periods prior to the adoption of EITF No.&nbsp;00-21 will continue with a declining
impact through 2008. QWBS amortized $76&nbsp;million in revenue related to such
prior period equipment sales in fiscal 2004, compared to $95&nbsp;million in fiscal
2003, including $23&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 after the
adoption of EITF No.&nbsp;00-21. The net increase in QWBS revenue is primarily
attributable to the accounting change for certain equipment sales, with a
smaller contribution from a $14&nbsp;million increase in messaging revenue as a
result of a larger installed base. QWBS shipped approximately 53,000 OmniTRACS
and other related communications systems during fiscal 2004, compared to
approximately 38,000 in fiscal 2003. The increase in QIS revenue is primarily
attributable to a $53&nbsp;million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW
customer base and products, partially offset by a $19&nbsp;million decrease in QChat
revenue resulting from the wind down of development efforts under the licensing
agreement with Nextel.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $30&nbsp;million, compared to
$27&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. QWI&#146;s operating margin percentage was 5% in both
fiscal 2004 and 2003. The increase in QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes was primarily
due to a $31&nbsp;million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the
increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products,
offset by a $30&nbsp;million increase in QWI research and development and selling,
general and administrative expenses. QWI&#146;s operating margin percentage remained
flat in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to a decline in
QWBS gross margin percentage, offset by an improvement in QIS gross margin
percentage. The decline in QWBS gross margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in equipment
sales, with margins that were lower than the margins on messaging services, as
a percentage of total QWBS revenue. The improvement in QIS gross margin
percentage is primarily attributable to the increase in fees related to our
expanded BREW customer base and products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, QWBS began the process of moving
high volume, standard product manufacturing to Mexico to reduce manufacturing
costs. The low volume, prototype and new product manufacturing activities will
remain in San Diego. The move is anticipated to be completed by the third
quarter of fiscal 2005. QWBS may incur additional costs in the near term as a
result of this move. In connection with this activity, we continue to evaluate
other low cost manufacturing opportunities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QSI Segment. </I></B>QSI&#146;s losses before taxes from continuing operations for
fiscal 2004 were $3&nbsp;million, compared to $168&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. Equity
in losses of investees decreased by $42&nbsp;million primarily due to a decrease in
losses incurred by Inquam during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, of
which our share was $59&nbsp;million for fiscal 2004 as compared to $99&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, we recorded $12&nbsp;million in
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and other investments as
compared to $127&nbsp;million for fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, we also recorded
a $34&nbsp;million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to
developments that affected strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. These
improvements in QSI&#146;s losses before taxes were partially offset by a $31
million decrease in interest income resulting from the prepayment of the Pegaso
debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $2,374&nbsp;million for fiscal
2003, compared to $1,546&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. The increase in MSM and
accompanying RF integrated circuits revenue was primarily related to higher
unit shipments. Approximately 99&nbsp;million MSM integrated circuits were sold
during fiscal 2003, compared to approximately 65&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $797&nbsp;million, compared to
$438&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. QCT&#146;s operating income as a percentage of its
revenues was 33% in fiscal 2003, compared to 28% in fiscal 2002. The operating
margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 increased primarily
as a result of the 53% increase in revenues as compared to the 17% increase in
research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses were
$58&nbsp;million higher and $17&nbsp;million higher, respectively, for fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002, primarily associated with increased investment in new
integrated circuit products and technology research, development and marketing
initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet
access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork products including CDMA2000,
1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV and WCDMA.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for fiscal 2002, we estimated royalties of $150&nbsp;million from
the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The actual
royalties reported to us by the Estimated Licensees, on a one quarter lag
basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were $167&nbsp;million. The variance
of $17&nbsp;million recorded in royalty revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2003
was primarily attributable to greater phone sales at higher average prices by
our Estimated Licensees than we had anticipated. Total royalty revenues from
licensees for fiscal 2003 of $838&nbsp;million included: 1) the prior year fourth
quarter variance of $17&nbsp;million, 2) other royalties reported by licensees
during fiscal 2003 of $670&nbsp;million and 3) the estimate made for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 of $151&nbsp;million based upon Estimated Licensees&#146;
estimated sales during that quarter, which we estimated would be reported by
the Estimated Licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QTL&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $897&nbsp;million, compared to
$756&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. QTL&#146;s operating margin percentage was 89% in both
fiscal 2003 and 2002. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes
was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees,
resulting from higher demand for CDMA products across all major regions of CDMA
deployment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QWI Segment. </I></B>QWI revenues for fiscal 2003 were $511&nbsp;million, compared to
$460&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. Revenues increased primarily due to a $19&nbsp;million
increase in QWBS revenue, an $11&nbsp;million increase in revenue related to the
sale of test equipment used primarily in testing WCDMA networks, a $10&nbsp;million
increase in QGOV revenue, primarily as a result of license revenue related to
the sale of the Technicolor Digital Cinema, LLC joint venture, and an $11
million increase in software and services revenue related to our QPoint and
BREW products. As a result of the adoption of EITF No.&nbsp;00-21 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, QWBS started recording revenue for certain equipment
sales upon shipment instead of amortizing the related revenue over a future
period. QWBS amortized $95&nbsp;million in revenue related to such prior period
equipment sales in fiscal 2003, including $23&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003 after the adoption of EITF No.&nbsp;00-21, compared to $103&nbsp;million
in fiscal 2002. The net increase in QWBS revenue is primarily attributable to
the accounting change for certain equipment sales and a $14&nbsp;million increase in
messaging revenue as a result of a larger installed base. QWBS shipped
approximately 38,000 OmniTRACS and other related communications systems during
fiscal 2003, compared to approximately 46,000 in fiscal 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $27&nbsp;million, compared to
earnings before losses of $7&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. QWI&#146;s operating margin
percentage was 5% in fiscal 2003, compared to negative 1% in fiscal 2002. The
increase in QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $25&nbsp;million
increase in QWBS gross margin. The increase in QWBS gross margin was primarily
attributable to $11&nbsp;million in gross margin amortized in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003 related to equipment sales in prior periods, while equipment sales
during the fourth quarter were recognized upon shipment, a $12&nbsp;million increase
in messaging services which have higher gross margins than equipment sales and
the effect of a $6&nbsp;million release of warranty reserves resulting from the
substantial completion of a QWBS warranty program. The improvement in QWI&#146;s
operating margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily related to the decrease in research and
development and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
QWI&#146;s revenues.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QSI Segment. </I></B>QSI&#146;s losses before taxes from continuing operations for
fiscal 2003 were $168&nbsp;million, compared to $346&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. During
fiscal 2003, we recorded a $97&nbsp;million decrease in other-than-temporary losses
on marketable securities and a $55&nbsp;million decrease in losses on derivative
instruments. Equity in losses of investees increased by $56&nbsp;million primarily
due to an increase in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $99
million for fiscal 2003 as compared to $45&nbsp;million for fiscal 2002. During
fiscal 2003, we also recorded other income of $47&nbsp;million related to the
transfer of portions of the FCC auction discount voucher value to two wireless
operators, partially offset by a $34&nbsp;million impairment loss on our wireless
licenses in Australia due to developments that affected strategic alternatives
for using the spectrum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.6&nbsp;billion at
September&nbsp;30, 2004, an increase of $2.3&nbsp;billion from September&nbsp;30, 2003. The
increase during fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of $2.5&nbsp;billion in cash
provided by operating activities, $330&nbsp;million in net proceeds from the
issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase
plans and $196&nbsp;million in net collections on finance receivables, mainly
comprised of the prepayment from Pegaso, partially offset by $332&nbsp;million in
capital expenditures, $308&nbsp;million in dividend payments and $70&nbsp;million
invested in other entities and acquisitions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable increased by 20% during fiscal 2004. The increase in
accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in sales of integrated
circuits, partially offset by the effect of the change in the timing of
recognizing
royalties. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 43&nbsp;days at
September&nbsp;30, 2004, compared to 48&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;30, 2003. The change in
days sales outstanding is primarily attributable to the effect of the change in
the timing of recognizing royalties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2003, we authorized the expenditure of up to $1&nbsp;billion to
repurchase shares of our common stock over a two-year period. In fiscal 2003,
we bought 9,830,000 shares at a net aggregate cost of $158&nbsp;million. While we
did not repurchase any of our common stock during fiscal 2004, we continue to
evaluate repurchases under this program. In connection with our stock
repurchase program, we sold put options in March&nbsp;2004 that could have required
us to purchase 3,000,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise. We
repurchased all of the put options in July&nbsp;2004. We recorded $5&nbsp;million in
premiums received for the put options as investment income. At September&nbsp;30,
2004, $834&nbsp;million remains authorized for repurchases under the program. We
announced dividends totaling approximately $307&nbsp;million and $135&nbsp;million, or
$0.190 and $0.085 per share, during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities
and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working and other
capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on current business
plans, including investments in other companies and other assets to support the
growth of our business, financing for customers of CDMA infrastructure products
in accordance with the agreements with Ericsson, financing under agreements
with CDMA telecommunications operators, other commitments, the payment of
dividends and possible additional stock buy backs. We started construction of
two facilities in San Diego, California in fiscal 2003, totaling approximately
one million additional square feet, to meet the requirements projected in our
long-term business plan. The remaining cost of these new facilities is expected
to be approximately $250&nbsp;million through fiscal 2007. We recently announced our
plans to expand our current Network Operations Center in Las Vegas, Nevada,
which uses GPS and other technologies to track freight transportation and
shipping nationwide. We expect the cost of this expansion will be approximately
$52&nbsp;million through fiscal 2007. We expect to place the new and expanded
facilities in service starting in fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2007.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to continue our strategic investment activities to promote the
worldwide adoption of CDMA products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless data
and wireless Internet products, although to a lesser extent than in prior
years. As part of these investment activities, we may provide financing to
facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by authorized suppliers. In
the event additional needs for cash arise, we may raise additional funds from a
combination of sources including potential debt and equity issuance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we and the Other Investor in
Inquam committed to fund an additional $2&nbsp;million each. While we have no other
obligations to provide funding to Inquam, we continue to have active
discussions with Inquam and the Other Investor concerning the necessary funding
for all or part of Inquam&#146;s business

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Future Accounting Requirements</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14, &#147;Whether an Investor
Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common
Stock.&#148; EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14 addresses whether the equity method of accounting
applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of
an investee but exercises significant influence through other means. EITF Issue
No.&nbsp;02-14 states that an investor should only apply the equity method of
accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in-substance
common stock of a corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee. The accounting provisions of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14 are effective for
the first quarter of fiscal 2005. We are in the process of determining the
effect, if any, the adoption of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14 will have on our financial
statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No.&nbsp;03-1, &#147;The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments&#148;
which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity
investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No.&nbsp;03-1 includes new disclosure
requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In
September&nbsp;2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF Issue No.
03-1; however, the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been
adopted for our year ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. We will evaluate the effect, if
any, of EITF 03-1 when final guidance is released.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest Rate Market Risk. </I></B>We have fixed income securities consisting of
cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities. We also have
diversified portfolios of non-investment grade securities managed by
institutional portfolio managers, which are subject to a higher degree of
default risk than our investment grade fixed income portfolios. Changes in the
general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values
and yields of fixed income investments. Our fixed income investments have grown
significantly in size and are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. If
interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of
time, our fixed income investments could lose value. If the general economy
were to weaken significantly, the credit profile of issuers of securities held
in our investment portfolios could deteriorate and our fixed income investments
could lose value. We may implement investment strategies of different types
with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. See
&#147;Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#151; Marketable Securities&#148; for
information about investments in marketable debt securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have finance receivables and notes receivable (both included in other
assets) that bear interest at fixed rates. See &#147;Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements &#151; Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions&#148; for
information about finance receivables. Finance receivables and notes that bear
interest at fixed rates could lose value if interest rates increase.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table provides information about our financial instruments
that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our fixed income
investment portfolio, the table presents principal cash flows and related
weighted-average yield at cost. For our finance receivables and notes
receivable, the table presents contractual interest rates by expected maturity
dates. Additionally, we have assumed that our fixed income securities are
similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate those securities
for presentation purposes.

securities, equity mutual fund shares and derivative instruments subject to
equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities
increased to $765&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2004 from $140&nbsp;million at September
30, 2003. The recorded value of equity mutual fund shares was $296&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;30, 2004. The recorded value of derivative instrument assets, mainly
comprised of warrants, subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.&nbsp;133 (FAS 133) &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,&#148; at September&nbsp;30, 2004 was $4&nbsp;million. We generally invest in
companies in the high-technology industry, and typically do not attempt to
reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities. The portfolio&#146;s
concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time,
and changes in concentrations may affect the portfolio&#146;s price volatility.
During the last three years, many technology stocks experienced significant
decreases in value, negatively affecting the fair values of our

in the market price of our marketable
equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at September&nbsp;30, 2004
would cause a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these
securities, or $106&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of
investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and
cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that our exposure to market risk from
these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not anticipate any
near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management&#146;s
objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded
values of these strategic investments totaled $162&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30,
2004.

Results in this Annual Report.

contracts. Derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools
and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September&nbsp;30, 2004,
the value of our foreign currency forward contracts was insignificant, and
there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding. See &#147;Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements &#151; The Company and its Significant Accounting
Policies&#148; for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those
entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect
reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements
in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated
with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and
certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could
experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash
flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of
investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States
customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed,
adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more
expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance receivables and notes receivable from international operators and
customers that do not use the United States dollar as their functional
currencies subject us to credit risk. Because our financing is U.S. dollar
denominated, any significant change in the value of the U.S. dollar against the
debtors&#146; functional currencies could result in an increase in the debtor&#146;s cash
flow requirements and could thereby affect our ability to collect our
receivables. At September&nbsp;30, 2004, finance and note receivables from
international operators and customers totaled $2&nbsp;million, net of allowances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above
should not be considered projections of future risks.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange

&#151; Integrated Framework</I>, our management concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September
30, 2004.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of QUALCOMM Incorporated

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a) (1)&nbsp;present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the
&#147;Company&#148;) at September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September
30, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (2)&nbsp;presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also, in our
opinion, management&#146;s assessment, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A,
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September&nbsp;30, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September&nbsp;30, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company&#146;s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on (i)&nbsp;these financial
statements and financial statement schedule; (ii)&nbsp;management&#146;s assessment; and
(iii)&nbsp;the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,&#148; during the year ended September&nbsp;30, 2003.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Company</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM), a Delaware corporation,
develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications
products and services based on its Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
technology. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based
integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data
communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products to
wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers. The Company grants licenses
to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain
patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA
products, and receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on sales
by licensees of wireless telecommunications equipment products incorporating
its CDMA technologies. The Company provides satellite and terrestrial-based
two-way data messaging and position reporting services for transportation
companies, private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise
companies. The Company provides the BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for
Wireless) product and services to network operators, handset manufacturers and
application developers and support for developing and delivering over-the-air
wireless applications and services. The Company also makes strategic
investments to promote the worldwide adoptions of CDMA products and services
for wireless voice and Internet data communications.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Principles of Consolidation</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the assets,
liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries and other
subsidiaries controlled by the Company. The ownership of the other interest
holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest and is
not significant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. The Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements one month in arrears to facilitate the timely
inclusion of such entities in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company deconsolidated the V&#233;sper Operating Companies during the first
quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of their sale in December&nbsp;2003 and TowerCo
during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of its sale in March&nbsp;2004
(Note 11). Results of operations and cash flows related to the V&#233;sper Operating
Companies and TowerCo are presented as discontinued operations. The Company&#146;s
statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been
adjusted to present the discontinued operations. The balance sheet as of
September&nbsp;28, 2003 was not adjusted to present assets and liabilities related
to discontinued operations separately.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Company adopted the revised interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB)&nbsp;Interpretation No.&nbsp;46 (FIN 46), &#147;Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,&#148; (FIN 46-R). FIN 46-R requires that certain variable
interest entities be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if
the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties. The Company does not have any investments in
entities it believes are variable interest entities for which the Company is
the primary beneficiary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Financial Statement Preparation</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure
of contingent amounts in the Company&#146;s financial statements and the
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Fiscal Year</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company operates and reports using a 52-week fiscal year ending on the
last Sunday in September. The fiscal years ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, 2003 and
2002 each include 52&nbsp;weeks. For presentation purposes, the Company presents its
fiscal years as ending on September&nbsp;30.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Revenue Recognition</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit
products, from royalties for its intellectual property, from messaging and
other services and related hardware sales, from software development and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">related services, and from license fees for intellectual property. The timing
of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each
case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each
arrangement and the nature of the Company&#146;s deliverables and obligations. The
development stage of the Company&#146;s customers&#146; products do not affect the timing
or amount of revenue recognized.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&nbsp;issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;101 (SAB 101), &#147;Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements&#148; (later revised as Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104) which the
Company adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and applied retroactively
to the first quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company recorded a $147&nbsp;million loss,
net of taxes of $98&nbsp;million, as the cumulative effect of the accounting change
as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 to reflect the deferral of revenues and
expenses related to future periods. The amortization of revenue that was
deferred as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 is expected to continue to be
amortized with a declining impact through fiscal 2007. The Company recognized
$30&nbsp;million, $44&nbsp;million and $66&nbsp;million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, in operating income related to revenues and expenses that were
recognized in prior years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)&nbsp;issued Issue No.
00-21, &#147;Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables&#148; which
the Company adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. This issue addresses
determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable
contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration
should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. Beginning
with the adoption of SAB 101 until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company recognized revenues and expenses from sales of certain satellite and
terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting hardware and
related software products by its QWBS division (Note 10) ratably over the
shorter of the estimated useful life of the hardware product or the expected
messaging service period, which is typically five years. SAB 101 required the
ratable recognition of these sales because the messaging service was considered
integral to the functionality of the hardware and software. EITF Issue No.
00-21 does not require the deferral of revenue when an undelivered element is
considered integral to the functionality of a delivered element and otherwise
requires separate unit accounting in multiple element arrangements. Given that
the Company meets the criteria stipulated in EITF Issue No.&nbsp;00-21, the sale of
the hardware is accounted for as a unit of accounting separate from the future
service to be provided by the Company. Accordingly, the Company began recognizing
revenues allocated to the hardware using the residual method, and related
expenses from such sales, starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 at the
time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other
criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later, instead of amortizing the
related revenue over a future period. The Company elected to adopt EITF Issue
No.&nbsp;00-21 prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into after the third
quarter of fiscal 2003, rather than reporting the change in accounting as a
cumulative-effect adjustment. The amortization of QWBS equipment revenue that
was deferred in the periods prior to the adoption of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;00-21 will
continue with a declining impact through fiscal 2008. QWBS amortized $76
million and $23&nbsp;million in revenue related to such prior period equipment sales
in fiscal 2004 and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, respectively.
Deferred revenues and expenses related to the historical QWBS sales that will
continue to be amortized in future periods were $106&nbsp;million and $62&nbsp;million,
respectively, at September&nbsp;30, 2004. Gross margin related to these prior sales
is expected to be recognized as follows: $24&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005, $13
million in fiscal 2006, $6&nbsp;million in fiscal 2007 and $1&nbsp;million in fiscal
2008.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company licenses rights to use portions of its intellectual property
portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in
the manufacture and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne,
CDMA2000, 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. Licensees typically
pay a nonrefundable license fee in one or more installments and ongoing
royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using the Company&#146;s
licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated
period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven
years. The Company earns royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold
worldwide by its licensees at the time that the licensees&#146; sales occur. The
Company&#146;s licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in
any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some
instances, although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a
semi-annual basis. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004, the Company estimated and recorded the royalty
revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees)
in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates
of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were estimated.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Royalties for licensees for which the Company had minimal reporting history and
certain licensees that did not incorporate the Company&#146;s integrated circuit
products into their own products were recorded one quarter in arrears, i.e. in
the quarter in which the royalties were reported to the Company by those
licensees. Estimates of royalty revenues for the Estimated Licensees were based
on analyses of the Company&#146;s sales of integrated circuits to Estimated
Licensees, historical royalty data for Estimated Licensee, an estimate of the
time between the Company&#146;s sales of integrated circuits to Estimated Licensees
and Estimated Licensees&#146; sales of CDMA products, average sales price forecasts,
estimates of inventory levels and current market and economic trends. Once
royalty reports were received from the Estimated Licensees, the variance
between such reports and the estimate was recorded as royalty revenue in the
quarter in which the reports were received, i.e. in most cases, the quarter
subsequent to the quarter in which the estimated royalties were recorded as
revenue.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for fiscal 2003, the Company estimated royalties of $151
million from the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The
actual royalties reported to the Company by the Estimated Licensees, on a one
quarter lag basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $208&nbsp;million.
The variance of $57&nbsp;million was recorded in royalty revenues in the first
quarter of fiscal 2004. Therefore, total royalty revenues from licensees for
fiscal 2004 of $1,141&nbsp;million included: 1) the prior year fourth quarter
variance of $57&nbsp;million and 2) other royalties reported by licensees during
fiscal 2004 of $1,084&nbsp;million. The Company did not estimate royalty revenues
for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 due to a change in the
Company&#146;s ability to estimate
royalties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company determined
that, due to recent escalating business trends, the Company no longer has the
ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from certain licensees. These
escalating trends include the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA
networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global
competition and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished
product inventories of licensees. Accordingly, the Company did not estimate
royalty revenues earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Starting in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company began recognizing revenues solely
based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in
the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing
royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalties
reported by the Company&#146;s licensees were $151&nbsp;million higher than royalty
revenues from external licensees recorded in fiscal 2004 because $151&nbsp;million
in royalties that were reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 had been
estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. To
facilitate an understanding of the impact of the change, the following table
compares royalty revenues recorded as revenue in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 to
royalties reported by the Company&#146;s licensees during those same periods (in
millions):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">*Recorded as revenue in the prior year, but reported by
licensees during the current year.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table above illustrates that the difference between royalties reported
by external licensees and royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in
the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations has equaled the difference
between the estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the current year and
the estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the prior year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of the Company&#146;s CDMA-based integrated circuits are
recognized at the time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the
customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later. Revenues
from providing services are recorded when earned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from long-term contracts are generally recognized using the
percentage-of-completion efforts-expended method of accounting, based on costs
incurred compared with total estimated costs. The percentage-of-completion
method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs. Revenue and
profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion.
Revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period
in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. If actual
contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of contract profit would be
required. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and
accrued profit are classified as unearned revenue. Estimated contract losses
are recognized when determined. If substantive uncertainty related to customer
acceptance exists or the contract&#146;s duration is relatively short, the Company
uses the completed-contract method.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides both perpetual and renewable time-based software
licenses. Revenues from software license fees are recognized when all of the
following criteria are met: the written agreement is executed; the software is
delivered; the license fee is fixed and determinable; collectibility of the
license fee is probable; and if applicable, when vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of
multiple-element arrangements, including post-contract customer support. When
contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor-specific objective evidence
exists for all undelivered elements, the Company recognizes revenue for the
delivered elements and defers revenue for the fair value of the undelivered
elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied. If
vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements,
revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining
obligations have been satisfied, or if the only undelivered element is
post-contract customer support and vendor specific objective evidence of the
fair value of post-contract customer support does not exist, revenue from the
entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. Judgments and
estimates are made in connection with the recognition of software license
revenue, which may include assessments of collectibility, the fair value of
deliverable elements and the implied support period. The amount or timing of
the Company&#146;s software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in
these judgments or estimates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs,
including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs.
Such reductions to revenue are estimates, which are based on a number of
factors, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer
sales volumes and the contractual provisions of the customer agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products
and license fees for intellectual property for which delivery is not yet
complete and to hardware products sales with a continuing service obligation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Concentrations</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant portion of the Company&#146;s revenues is concentrated with a
limited number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless
telecommunications products is dominated by a small number of large
corporations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola, customers of
the Company&#146;s QCT, QTL, QWI and other nonreportable segments, comprised 15%,
15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2004, as
compared to 17%, 13% and 13% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in
fiscal 2003. Revenues from Samsung, Kyocera and LG Electronics, customers of
the Company&#146;s QCT, QTL, QWI and other nonreportable segments, comprised 16%,
14% and 12% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2002.
Aggregated accounts receivable from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola
comprised 51% and 48% of gross accounts receivable at September&nbsp;30, 2004 and
2003, respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from international customers were approximately 79%, 77% and 69%
of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Cost of equipment and services revenues</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of equipment and services revenues is primarily comprised of the cost
of equipment revenues, the cost of messaging services revenues and the cost of
development and other services revenues. Cost of equipment revenues consists of
the cost of equipment sold and sustaining engineering costs, including
personnel and related costs. Cost of messaging services revenues consists
principally of satellite transponder costs, network operations expenses,
including personnel and related costs, depreciation, and airtime charges by
telecommunications operators. Cost of development and other services revenues
primarily includes personnel costs and related expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Research and Development</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed as
incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after
technological feasibility of the software is established.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shipping and Handling Costs</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of revenues
at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a customer for
shipping and handling are reported as revenue.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income Taxes</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in income in the period
such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Cash Equivalents</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and
government agencies&#146; securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value
due to the short maturities of these instruments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marketable Securities</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each
balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost,
which approximates fair value. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair
value as determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the
balance sheet date. The net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities are reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss), net of
tax. The specific identification method is used to compute the realized gains
and losses on debt and equity securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its
marketable securities. When assessing marketable securities for
other-than-temporary declines in value, the Company considers such factors as,
among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of
the original cost, how long the market value of

than its original cost, the performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in
relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the
market in general, analyst recommendations, any news that has been released
specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the
investee operates. The Company also reviews the financial statements of the
investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties
and considers new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming that
will improve its operating results. If events and circumstances indicate that a
decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary,
the Company records a charge to investment income (expense).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Allowances for Doubtful Accounts</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of the Company&#146;s customers to make required
payments. The Company considers the following factors when determining if
collection of a fee is reasonably assured: customer credit-worthiness, past
transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends and
changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience
with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from various credit
organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its
creditors. The Company may also request financial information, including
financial statements or other documents (e.g., bank statements) to ensure that
the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate
collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until collection becomes
reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. If the financial
condition of the Company&#146;s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting
their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of entities it has financed to make
required payments. The Company evaluates the adequacy of allowances for
doubtful finance and note receivables based on analyses of the financed
entities&#146; credit-worthiness, current economic trends or market conditions,
review of the entities&#146; current and projected financial and operational
information, and consideration of the fair value of collateral to be received,
if applicable. From time to time, the Company may consider third party
evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. If the
financial condition of the financed entities were to deteriorate, adversely
affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inventories</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost,
not to exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method.
Recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of committed purchase
orders from customers, as well as purchase commitment projections provided by
customers, among other things.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Property, Plant and Equipment</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or
amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over 30&nbsp;years and 15&nbsp;years,
respectively. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease. Other
property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging from two to 15&nbsp;years.
Direct external and internal costs of developing software for internal use are
capitalized subsequent to the preliminary stage of development. Maintenance,
repairs, and minor renewals and betterments are charged to expense as incurred.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the
related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and the
gain or loss is recorded.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other Investments</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Investments in Other Entities</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company makes strategic investments in companies that have developed
or are developing innovative wireless data applications and wireless operators
that promote the worldwide deployment of CDMA systems. Investments in corporate
entities with less than a 20% voting interest are generally accounted for under
the cost method. The Company uses the equity method to account for investments
in corporate entities, including limited liability corporations that do not
maintain specific ownership accounts, in which it has a voting interest of 20%

limited liability corporations that do maintain specific ownership accounts, or
in which it otherwise has the ability to exercise significant influence. Under
the equity method, the investment is originally recorded at cost and adjusted
to recognize the Company&#146;s share of net earnings or losses of the investee,
limited to the extent of the Company&#146;s investment in and advances to the
investee and financial guarantees on behalf of the investee that create
additional basis.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its
investments. When assessing an investment for an other-than-temporary decline
in value, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, the share
price from the investee&#146;s latest financing round, the performance of the
investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the
investee&#146;s revenue and cost trends, as well as liquidity and cash position,
including its cash burn rate, market acceptance of the investee&#146;s
products/services as well as any new products or
services that may be forthcoming, any significant news that has been
released specific to the investee or the investee&#146;s competitors and/or
industry, and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee
operates. From time to time, the Company may consider third party evaluations,
valuation reports or advice from investment banks. If events and circumstances
indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other
than temporary, the Company records a charge to investment income (expense).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Derivatives</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company holds warrants to purchase equity interests in certain other
companies related to its strategic investment activities. The Company&#146;s
warrants are not held for trading purposes. Certain of the Company&#146;s warrants
are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in investment
income (expense)&nbsp;as gains (losses)&nbsp;on derivative instruments because the
warrants do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Warrants that do
not have contractual net settlement provisions are recorded at cost.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
hedge certain foreign currency transactions and probable anticipated foreign
currency transactions. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward
and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are
recorded in investment income (expense)&nbsp;as gains (losses)&nbsp;on derivative
instruments. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign
currency forward and option contracts that are designated as cash-flow hedging
instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;as
gains (losses)&nbsp;on derivative instruments until the underlying transaction
affects the Company&#146;s earnings. The value of the Company&#146;s foreign currency
forward contracts was insignificant at September&nbsp;30, 2004. The Company had no
foreign currency option contracts outstanding at September&nbsp;30, 2004. The
Company had no foreign currency forward or option contracts outstanding at
September&nbsp;30, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003, the recorded value of the Company&#146;s
derivative instruments totaled $4&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million, respectively, and
none of the Company&#146;s derivatives were designated as hedges. The Company&#146;s
derivative instruments are included in other assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over
the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
businesses acquired. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company
fully adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;141 (FAS 141),
&#147;Business Combinations,&#148; and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142 (FAS 142), &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; The provisions of FAS
141 (1)&nbsp;require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated after June&nbsp;30, 2001, (2)&nbsp;provide specific criteria for
the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from
goodwill, and (3)&nbsp;require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off
immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized.
FAS 141 also requires that, upon adoption of FAS 142, the Company reclassify
the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill,
based on certain criteria. Upon the adoption of FAS 142, the Company
reclassified approximately $2&nbsp;million of certain intangible assets into
goodwill.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAS 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible
assets subsequent to their initial recognition. The provisions of FAS 142 (1)
prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,

purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill, and (4)&nbsp;remove the
forty-year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have
finite lives. The Company completed its transitional testing for goodwill
impairment upon adoption of FAS 142 and its annual testing for fiscal 2004 and
2003 and determined that its recorded goodwill was not impaired.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill
amortization. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods
if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be
impaired. Software development costs are capitalized when a product&#146;s
technological feasibility has been established through the date a product is
available for general release to customers. Software development costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the
software, ranging from less than one year to four years, taking into account
such factors as the effects of obsolescence, technological advances and
competition. The weighted-average amortization period for capitalized software
was one year at both September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003. Other intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, ranging from three
to 28&nbsp;years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighted-average amortization periods for finite lived intangible assets,
by class, were as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144
(FAS 144), &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148; as
of the beginning of fiscal 2003. The adoption of this accounting standard did
not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial
position. The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets
when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. An impairment loss is
recognized when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable
and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">eventual disposition of the asset. Any required impairment loss is measured as
the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair
value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset
and a charge to operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Litigation</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The
Company estimates the range of liability related to pending litigation where
the amount and range of loss can be estimated. The Company records its best
estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is
probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the
range, the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to the
claim. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the
potential liability related to the Company&#146;s pending litigation and revises its
estimates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Guarantees and Product Warranties</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the normal course of business, the Company may provide guarantees to
other parties. Upon issuance of a guarantee, the Company recognizes a liability
for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee, as
required. At September&nbsp;30, 2004, liabilities related to guarantees were
approximately $1&nbsp;million. At September&nbsp;30, 2003, liabilities related to
guarantees were not significant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated future warranty obligations related to certain products are
provided by charges to operations in the period in which the related revenue is
recognized. The Company establishes a reserve for warranty obligations based on
its historical warranty experience. Warranty obligations were $2&nbsp;million and $4
million at September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and changes in the
obligations were not significant during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stock-Based Compensation</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based
upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 25 (APB 25), &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.&#148; Because the Company establishes the exercise price based on the
fair market value of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of grant, the stock
options have no intrinsic value upon grant, and therefore no expense is
recorded. Each quarter, the Company reports the potential dilutive impact of
stock options in its diluted earnings per common share using the treasury-stock
method. Out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., the average stock price during
the period is below the strike price of the stock option) are not included in
diluted earnings per common share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.&nbsp;123
(FAS 123), &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,&#148; and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;148 (FAS 148), &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation &#150; Transition and Disclosure,&#148; the pro forma effects of stock-based
compensation on net income and earnings per common share have been estimated at
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the
following assumptions:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no restrictions and are fully
transferable and negotiable in a free trading market. The Black-Scholes model
does not consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that are
inherent in the Company&#146;s employee stock options. Use of an option valuation
model, as required by FAS 123, includes highly subjective assumptions based on
long-term predictions, including the expected stock price volatility and
average life of each stock option grant. Because the Company&#146;s employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of freely
traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the Company&#146;s

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign subsidiaries operating in a local currency environment use the
local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated to United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date; revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at
rates of exchange that approximate the rates in effect at the transaction date.
Resulting translation gains or losses are recognized as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss). The functional currency of the Company&#146;s foreign
investees that do not use local currencies is the United States dollar. Where
the United States dollar is the functional currency, the monetary assets and
liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses
associated with the monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates
of exchange that approximate the rates in effect at the transaction date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities and related elements of revenues, expenses,
gains and losses are translated at historical rates. Resulting translation
gains or losses of these foreign investees are recognized in the statements of
operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2004, net foreign currency transaction gains included in the
Company&#146;s statement of operations were $1&nbsp;million. During fiscal 2003 and 2002,
net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in the Company&#146;s
statements of operations were insignificant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Comprehensive Income</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business
enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. The Company presents
comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of stockholders&#146; equity.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stock Split</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;13, 2004, the Company announced a two-for-one stock split in the
form of a stock dividend. Stock was distributed on August&nbsp;13, 2004 to
stockholders of record as of July&nbsp;23, 2004. Stockholders&#146; equity has been
restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all periods
presented by reclassifying the par value of the additional shares arising from
the split from paid-in-capital to common stock. All references in the financial
statements and notes to number of shares and per share amounts reflect the
stock split.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Earnings Per Common Share</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by
the combination of dilutive common share equivalents, comprised of shares
issuable under the Company&#146;s stock-based compensation plans and shares subject
to written put options, and the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. The incremental dilutive common share
equivalents, calculated using the treasury stock method, for fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002 were approximately 58,686,000, 56,338,000 and 76,883,000,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee stock options to purchase approximately 40,221,000, 86,540,000
and 81,690,000 shares of common stock during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per common share because the option exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the common stock, and therefore, the effect on
dilutive earnings per common share would have been anti-dilutive. Put options
outstanding during fiscal 2004 to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock
were not included in the earnings per common share computation for fiscal 2004
because the put options&#146; exercise prices were less than the average market
price of the common stock while they were outstanding, and therefore, the
effect on diluted earnings per common share would be anti-dilutive (Note 7).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Future Accounting Requirements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14, &#147;Whether an Investor
Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common
Stock.&#148; EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14 addresses whether the equity method of accounting
applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of
an investee but exercises significant influence through other means. EITF Issue
No.&nbsp;02-14 states that an investor should only apply the equity method of
accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in-substance
common stock of a corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee. The accounting provisions of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14 are effective for
the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company is in the process of determining
the effect, if any, the adoption of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;02-14 will have on its
financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No.&nbsp;03-1, &#147;The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments&#148;
which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity
investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No.&nbsp;03-1 includes new disclosure
requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In
September&nbsp;2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF Issue

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company did not have any investments in
individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position
deemed to be temporary for more than 12&nbsp;months.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Investment Grade Debt Securities</I>. The Company&#146;s investments in investment
grade debt securities consist primarily of investments in certificates of
deposit, U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, foreign government bonds,
mortgage and asset-backed securities and corporate bonds and notes. The
unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investments in investment grade debt
securities were caused by interest rate increases. Due to the fact that the
decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not
credit quality, and because the severity and duration of the unrealized losses
were not significant, the Company considered these unrealized losses to be
temporary at September&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Non-Investment Grade Debt Securities. </I>The Company&#146;s investments in
non-investment grade debt securities consist primarily of investments in
corporate bonds. The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investment in
non-investment grade debt securities were caused by credit quality and industry
or company specific events. Because the severity and duration of the unrealized
losses were not significant, the Company considered these unrealized losses to
be temporary at September&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marketable Equity Securities. </I>The Company&#146;s investments in marketable
equity securities consist primarily of investments in common stock of large
companies and equity mutual funds. The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s
investment in marketable equity securities were caused by overall equity market
volatility and industry specific events. The duration and severity of the
unrealized losses in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual
investments were consistent with typical equity market volatility. Current
market forecasts support a recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the cost of
the investment within a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, the Company
considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September&nbsp;30, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of finance receivables
approximated $2&nbsp;million and $198&nbsp;million, respectively. The fair value of
finance receivables is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
current interest rates at which similar financing would be provided to similar
customers for the same remaining maturities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had various financing arrangements, including a bridge loan
facility, an equipment loan facility, and interim and additional interim loan
facilities, with Pegaso Comunicaciones y Sistemas S.A. de C.V., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V., a CDMA wireless operator
in Mexico (collectively referred to as Pegaso). On September&nbsp;10, 2002,
Telef&#243;nica M&#243;viles (Telef&#243;nica) acquired a 65% controlling interest in Pegaso.
On October&nbsp;10, 2002, Pegaso paid $82&nbsp;million in full satisfaction of the
interim and additional interim loans. On November&nbsp;8, 2002, Pegaso paid $435
million in full satisfaction of the bridge loan facility. The Company used
approximately $139&nbsp;million of the bridge loan proceeds to purchase outstanding
vendor debt owed by Pegaso to other lenders. On June&nbsp;13, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $281&nbsp;million of the
equipment loan facility, including accrued interest, in accordance with certain
terms of the equipment loan facility. On December&nbsp;15, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $193
million, including accrued interest, in full satisfaction of the equipment loan
facility. The Company recognized $12&nbsp;million, $41&nbsp;million and $9&nbsp;million in
interest income related to the Pegaso financing arrangements during fiscal

has a remaining commitment to extend up to $118&nbsp;million in long-term financing
to certain CDMA customers of Ericsson. The funding of this commitment, if it
occurs, is not subject to a fixed expiration date and is subject to the CDMA
customers meeting conditions prescribed in the financing arrangement and, in
certain cases, to Ericsson also financing a portion of such sales and services.
Financing under this arrangement is generally collateralized by the related
equipment. The commitment represents the maximum amount to be financed; actual
financing may be in lesser amounts.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gross carrying values of wireless licenses, customer-related
intangible assets and marketing-related intangible assets were reduced by $105
million, $5&nbsp;million and $1&nbsp;million, respectively, from September&nbsp;30, 2003 as a
result of discontinued operations (Note 11). During fiscal 2003, the Company
recorded a $34&nbsp;million impairment loss in its QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
segment on its wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected
potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The impairment loss
recognized was the difference between the assets&#146; carrying values and their
estimated fair values.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the Company&#146;s purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are
subject to amortization. Amortization expense from continuing operations for
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $17&nbsp;million, $18&nbsp;million and $14&nbsp;million,
respectively. Amortization expense related to these intangible assets is
expected to be $14&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005, $14&nbsp;million in fiscal 2006, $13
million in fiscal 2007, $9&nbsp;million in fiscal 2008 and $8&nbsp;million in fiscal
2009.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized software development costs, which are included in other
assets, were $44&nbsp;million and $36&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Accumulated amortization on capitalized software was $39&nbsp;million
and $26&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization
expense from continuing operations related to capitalized software for fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002 was $13&nbsp;million, $12&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inquam Limited</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has invested $200&nbsp;million in the convertible preferred shares
of Inquam Limited (Inquam) for an approximate 42% ownership interest in Inquam.
Inquam owns, develops and manages wireless communications systems, either
directly or indirectly, with the intent of deploying CDMA-based technology,
primarily in Europe. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company
and another investor (the Other Investor) also extended $117&nbsp;million in bridge
loan financings to Inquam, including $31&nbsp;million in bridge loan funding put in
place during fiscal 2004. The Company funded its approximate $58&nbsp;million share
of these bridge loans and had no remaining funding commitment at September&nbsp;30,
2004. Inquam is a variable interest entity. The Company does not consolidate
Inquam because it is not the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the equity
method to account for its investment in Inquam. The Company recorded $59
million, $99&nbsp;million and $45&nbsp;million in equity in losses of
Inquam during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At September&nbsp;30,
2004 and 2003, the Company&#146;s equity and debt investments in Inquam totaled $42
million and $68&nbsp;million, net of equity in losses, respectively. The carrying
amount of the Company&#146;s investment in Inquam exceeded its underlying equity in
the net assets of Inquam by $8&nbsp;million and $9&nbsp;million, at September&nbsp;30, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company agreed, along with the Other Investor,
to guarantee the payment of amounts due by Inquam under a bank credit
agreement. During fiscal 2004, the Company and the Other Investor agreed to
extend the guarantee and increase the maximum amount subject to the guarantee
to $55&nbsp;million. The Company&#146;s maximum liability under the guarantee is limited
to an amount equal to 50% of the amounts outstanding under Inquam&#146;s credit
agreement, up to a maximum of approximately $28&nbsp;million. Amounts outstanding
under the bank credit agreement totaled $53&nbsp;million as of September&nbsp;30, 2004.
The guarantee expires on November&nbsp;30, 2004 when the bank credit facility
matures. Inquam is currently working with the bank and other potential lenders
to secure long-term &#147;take out&#148; financing to repay the existing loan on the
maturity date. It is possible that the Company and the Other Investor may
provide additional guarantees in connection with such take out financing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company and the Other
Investor committed to fund an additional $2&nbsp;million each. While the Company has
no other obligations to provide funding to Inquam, the Company continues to
have active discussions with Inquam and the Other Investor concerning the
necessary funding for all or a part of Inquam&#146;s business plan, potential
restructuring and investment by other parties. While the Company may provide
some additional funding and/or credit support in furtherance of Inquam&#146;s
business plan, the amount and form of such support is unknown, and none will be
provided without commensurate support or consideration being provided by the
Other Investor.

summarized financial information, derived from its unaudited financial
statements, is as follows (in millions):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2004 and 2003, management determined that declines in the
market value of the Company&#146;s investment in Korea Telecom Freetel Co., Ltd.
(KTF), a wireless operator in South Korea, were other than temporary. In
reaching this conclusion, the decline in stock value as a percentage of the
original cost and the length of time in which the market value of the
investment had been below its original cost were considered. As a result, the
Company recorded $10&nbsp;million and $81&nbsp;million in other-than-temporary losses on
marketable securities in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company holds
4,416,000 common shares of KTF as of September&nbsp;30, 2004. The fair value of the
common shares was $72&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2002, management determined that declines in the market
values of the Company&#146;s investments in Leap Wireless International, Inc. (Leap
Wireless) were other than temporary when those values declined significantly
due to unfavorable business developments. Subsequently, Leap Wireless filed for
Chapter&nbsp;11 bankruptcy protection in April&nbsp;2003. The Company recorded $180
million in other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities related to its
debt and equity investments in Leap Wireless during fiscal 2002. The Company
also recorded $59&nbsp;million in losses related to changes in the fair values of
Leap Wireless derivative instruments for fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004, Leap
Wireless emerged from bankruptcy. As a result, the Company received a
distribution comprised of $19&nbsp;million in cash and $16&nbsp;million in equity in Leap
Wireless in exchange for its debt investments, and the Company recorded $34
million in net realized gains on marketable securities in fiscal 2004. The
Company&#146;s equity and derivative instruments in Leap Wireless were cancelled
without consideration. The fair value of the Company&#146;s new equity investment in
Leap Wireless was $14&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2004.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company did not provide for United States income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes on a cumulative total of approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion of
undistributed earnings from certain non-United States subsidiaries permanently
invested outside the United States. Should the Company repatriate foreign
earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the
period management determined that the Company would repatriate the earnings.
The Company is currently studying the impact of the one-time favorable foreign
dividend provisions enacted on October&nbsp;22, 2004, as part of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate future earnings of some of
its foreign subsidiaries. However, the decision to repatriate would
relate solely to future earnings to be generated after the date such
decision was made.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross deferred tax assets and valuation allowance each decreased by $495
million from September&nbsp;30, 2003, primarily as a result of discontinued
operations (Note 11), with no net effect on net deferred tax assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reversed approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion of its valuation allowance
on substantially all of its United States deferred tax assets during fiscal
2003 as a credit to stockholders&#146; equity. The Company believes it, more likely
than not, will have sufficient taxable income after stock option related
deductions to utilize its net deferred tax assets. As of September&nbsp;30, 2004,
the Company has provided a valuation allowance on net capital losses in the
amount of $139&nbsp;million. This valuation allowance reflects the uncertainty
surrounding the Company&#146;s ability to generate sufficient capital gains to
utilize all capital losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company had unused federal and state income tax
credits of $658&nbsp;million and $78&nbsp;million, respectively, generally expiring from
2005 through 2024. The Company does not expect these credits to expire unused.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $127
million, $125&nbsp;million and $89&nbsp;million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The income taxes paid primarily relate to foreign withholding
taxes.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for

conjunction with the distribution of preferred share purchase rights, 1,500,000
shares of preferred stock are designated as Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock and reserved such shares for issuance upon exercise of the
preferred share purchase rights. At September&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003, no shares of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan (Rights Plan) to
protect stockholders&#146; rights in the event of a proposed takeover of the
Company. Under the Rights Plan, the Company declared a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company&#146;s common
stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, each Right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from the Company a one one-hundredth share of
Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share,
subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, at a purchase price of $250.
In November&nbsp;1999, the Rights Plan was amended to provide that the purchase
price be set at $400. The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group (an
Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company&#146;s
outstanding shares of common stock. Upon exercise, holders, other than an
Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to termination, to receive the
Company&#146;s common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having a
market value, as defined, equal to twice such purchase price. The Rights, which
expire on September&nbsp;25, 2005, are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the
Company&#146;s option at any time for a price of $0.005 per Right.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stock Repurchase Program</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;10, 2003, the Company authorized the expenditure of up to $1
billion to repurchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock over a two-year
period. During fiscal 2003, the Company bought 9,830,000 shares at a net
aggregate cost of $158&nbsp;million. While the Company did not repurchase any of the
Company&#146;s common stock under this program during fiscal 2004, the Company
continues to evaluate repurchases under this program. At September&nbsp;30, 2004,
$834&nbsp;million remains authorized for repurchases under the program. Repurchased
shares are retired upon repurchase.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Company&#146;s stock repurchase program, the Company
sold put options under three separate contracts with independent third parties
during fiscal 2004 that may have required the Company to purchase 3,000,000
shares of its common stock upon exercise. The Company accounted for the written
put options in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards No.&nbsp;150 (FAS
150), &#147;Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
both Liabilities and Equity.&#148; In the event the put options were exercised, the
contracts required that the options be physically settled in cash. The Company
determined that the put options should be classified as liabilities in
accordance with FAS 150. As such, the Company recorded the $5&nbsp;million in
premiums received as additions to other current liabilities, and changes in the
fair values of the put options were recognized in the Company&#146;s statement of
operations. The Company repurchased all of the put options during fiscal 2004.
The net gain recorded in investment income related to the put options,
including premiums received, during fiscal 2004 was $5&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2003, the Company sold put options under three separate
contracts with independent third parties that required the Company to purchase
3,000,000 shares of its common stock upon exercise. All of these put options
expired unexercised. The Company classified the put options as permanent equity
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;00-19, &#147;Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company&#146;s Own Stock,&#148; which was subsequently amended by FAS 150. As such, the
Company recorded the $7&nbsp;million in premiums received as paid-in capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dividends</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;11, 2003, the Company announced its first common stock
dividend of $0.025 per share. On July&nbsp;16, 2003, the Company announced an
increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.025 to $0.035 per share on common
stock. On March&nbsp;2, 2004, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly
dividend from $0.035 to $0.050 per share on common stock. On July&nbsp;13, 2004, the
Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.050 to $0.070
per share on common stock. Cash dividends announced in fiscal 2004 and 2003
were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 8. Employee Benefit Plans</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Employee Savings and Retirement Plan</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows eligible employees to contribute
up to 50% of their eligible compensation, subject to annual limits. The Company
matches a portion of the employee contributions and may, at its discretion,
make additional contributions based upon earnings. The Company&#146;s contribution
expense for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $21&nbsp;million, $20&nbsp;million and $20
million, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stock Option Plans</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may grant options to selected employees, directors and
consultants to the Company to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at
a price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant.
The 2001 Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Plan) was adopted and replaced the 1991
Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan), which expired in August&nbsp;2001. Options
granted under the 1991 Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled.
The shares reserved under the 2001 Plan were equal to the number of shares
available for future grant under the 1991 Plan on the date the 2001 Plan was
approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders. At that date, approximately 101,083,000
shares were available for future grants under the 2001 Plan. In fiscal 2004,
the Company reserved another 64,000,000 shares for future grants under the 2001
Plan. The Company may terminate the 2001 Plan at any time. The 2001 Plan
provides for the grant of both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock
options. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding six
years and are exercisable for up to 10&nbsp;years from the grant date. At September
30, 2004, options for approximately 120,860,000 shares under both plans were
exercisable at prices ranging from $1.40 to $86.19 per share for an aggregate
exercise price of $2.1&nbsp;billion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has adopted the 2001 Non-Employee Directors&#146; Stock Option Plan
(the 2001 Directors&#146; Plan), which replaced the 1998 Non-Employee Directors&#146;
Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Directors&#146; Plan). Options granted under the 1998
Directors&#146; Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled. The shares
reserved under the 2001 Directors&#146; Plan are equal to the number of shares
available for future grant under the 1998 Directors&#146; Plan on the date the 2001
Directors&#146; Plan was approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders. At that date,
4,100,000 shares were available for future grants under the 2001 Directors&#146;
Plan. The Company may terminate the 2001 Directors&#146; Plan at any time. This plan
provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted to non-employee
directors at fair market value, vesting over periods not exceeding five years
and are exercisable for up to 10&nbsp;years from the grant date. At September&nbsp;30,
2004, options for approximately 3,232,000 shares under both plans were
exercisable at prices ranging from $2.91 to $66.50 per share for an aggregate
exercise price of $30&nbsp;million.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Employee Stock Purchase Plans</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has two employee stock purchase plans for all eligible
employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair
market value on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period.
Employees may authorize the Company to withhold up to 15% of their compensation
during any offering period, subject to certain limitations. The 2001 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to approximately 24,309,000 shares to be
granted. The 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to
400,000 shares to be granted. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, shares
totaling approximately 2,205,000, 2,744,000 and 2,300,000 were issued under the
plans at an average price of $18.60, $13.20 and $15.73 per share, respectively.
At September&nbsp;30, 2004, approximately 17,232,000 shares were reserved for future
issuance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Executive Retirement Plans</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has voluntary retirement plans that allow eligible executives
to defer up to 100% of their income on a pre-tax basis. On a quarterly basis,
the Company matches up to 10% of the participants&#146; deferral in Company common
stock based on the then-current market price, to be distributed to the
participant upon eligible retirement. The income deferred and the Company match
held in trust are unsecured and subject to the claims of general creditors of
the Company. Company contributions begin vesting based on certain minimum
participation or service requirements, and are fully vested at age 65.
Participants who terminate employment forfeit their unvested shares. All shares
forfeited are used to reduce the Company&#146;s future matching contributions. The
plans authorize up to 1,600,000 shares to be allocated to participants at any
time. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 108,000, 89,000 and
88,000 shares, respectively, were allocated under the plans. The Company
recorded $5&nbsp;million, $2&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million in compensation expense during
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to its net matching
contributions to the plans. At September&nbsp;30, 2004, approximately 331,000 shares
were reserved for future allocation.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Schwartz, et al v. QUALCOMM</I>: In fiscal 2001, 87 former QUALCOMM employees
filed a lawsuit against the Company in the District Court for Boulder County,
Colorado, alleging claims for intentional misrepresentation, nondisclosure and
concealment, violation of C.R.S. Section&nbsp;8-2-104 (obtaining workers by
misrepresentation), breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation,
unjust enrichment, violation of California Labor Code Section&nbsp;970, violation of
California Civil Code Sections&nbsp;1709-1710, rescission, violation of California
Business &#038; Professions Code Section&nbsp;17200 and violation of California Civil
Code Section&nbsp;1575. The complaint seeks economic, emotional distress and
punitive damages and unspecified amounts of interest. On November&nbsp;29, 2001, the Court granted the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss 17
of the plaintiffs from the lawsuit. Subsequently, the Court dismissed three
other plaintiffs from the lawsuit. On November&nbsp;18, 2002, the Court granted the
Company&#146;s motion to dismiss 61 of the remaining 67 plaintiffs from the lawsuit.
The Company subsequently resolved the matters with the remaining plaintiffs.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Those plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed have appealed. Oral argument on
the appeal occurred on October&nbsp;26, 2004, and no decision has been received.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Hanig et al. v. QUALCOMM, Boesel, et al v. QUALCOMM, Stone v. QUALCOMM,
Ortiz et al v. QUALCOMM, Shannon et al. v. QUALCOMM, Deshon et al v. QUALCOMM,
Earnhart et al. v. QUALCOMM</I>: These cases, the first of which was filed in
fiscal 2001, were filed in San Diego County Superior Court by over 100 former
employees, alleging claims for declaratory relief, breach of contract,
intentional/negligent fraud, concealment, rescission, specific performance,
work, labor and services, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, violation of California Business &#038; Professions Code Section&nbsp;17200 and
unjust enrichment, claiming that they were entitled to full vesting of unvested
stock options as a result of the sale of the Company&#146;s infrastructure business
to Ericsson in 1999. The Company has answered the complaints, which have been
consolidated, and discovery is ongoing. On July&nbsp;16, 2004, the Court granted the
Company&#146;s summary adjudication motion, dismissing plaintiffs&#146; breach of
contract claims.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Durante, et al v. QUALCOMM</I>: On February&nbsp;2, 2000, three former QUALCOMM
employees filed a putative class action against the Company, ostensibly on
behalf of themselves and those former employees of the Company whose employment
was terminated in April&nbsp;1999. Virtually all of the purported class of
plaintiffs received severance packages at the time of the termination of their
employment, in exchange for a release of claims, other than federal age
discrimination claims, against the Company. The complaint was filed in
California Superior Court in and for the County of Los Angeles and purports to
state 10 causes of action including breach of contract, age discrimination,
violation of Labor Code Section&nbsp;200, violation of Labor Code Section&nbsp;970,
unfair business practices, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust
enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, declaratory
relief and undue influence. The complaint seeks an order accelerating all
unvested stock options for the members of the class, plus economic and
liquidated damages of an unspecified amount. On June&nbsp;27, 2000, the case was
ordered transferred from Los Angeles County Superior Court to San Diego County
Superior Court. On July&nbsp;3, 2000, the Company removed the case to the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California, and discovery
commenced. On May&nbsp;29, 2001, the Court dismissed all plaintiffs&#146; claims except
for claims arising under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. On
July&nbsp;16, 2001, the Court granted conditional class certification on the
remaining claims, to be revisited by the Court at the end of the discovery
period. On April&nbsp;15, 2003, the Court granted the Company&#146;s summary judgment
motions as to all remaining class members&#146; disparate impact claims. On June&nbsp;18,
2003, the Court ordered decertification of the class and dismissed the
remaining claims of the opt-in plaintiffs without prejudice. Plaintiffs have
filed an appeal. On June&nbsp;20, 2003, 76 of the opt-in plaintiffs filed an action
in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging
violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of their
layoffs in 1999. To date, the complaint has not been served.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM, Inc. and SnapTrack,
Inc.</I>: On March&nbsp;30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. (Zoltar) filed
suit against QUALCOMM and SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a QUALCOMM wholly-owned
subsidiary, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California seeking damages and injunctive relief and alleging infringement of
three patents. On August&nbsp;27, 2001, Zoltar filed an amended complaint adding
Sprint Corp. as a named defendant and narrowing certain infringement claims
against QUALCOMM and SnapTrack. Since then, Zoltar has dismissed Sprint Corp.
as a defendant. Trial of this matter commenced on February&nbsp;24, 2004. On March
25, 2004, the jury reached a unanimous verdict of no infringement in favor of
the Company and SnapTrack on six of the seven patent claims asserted by Zoltar.
On July&nbsp;26, 2004, the Court found no infringement on the remaining patent claim
asserted by Zoltar and entered a judgment in favor of the Company and SnapTrack
on Zoltar&#146;s complaint and awarded the Company and SnapTrack their costs of
suit. Zoltar has noticed an appeal and the Company and SnapTrack have filed a
responsive notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Texas Instruments Incorporated v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On July&nbsp;25, 2003,
the Company filed an action in Delaware Superior Court against Texas
Instruments Incorporated for breach of a patent portfolio license agreement
between the parties, seeking damages and other relief. On September&nbsp;23, 2003,
Texas Instruments filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court against the Company
alleging breach of the same agreement, seeking damages and other relief. The
Company has since dismissed its case in Superior Court and refiled its claims
as part of the action in the Chancery Court. In a written order dated July&nbsp;14,
2004, the Court granted QUALCOMM&#146;s summary judgment motion, dismissing all of
Texas Instruments&#146; claims against QUALCOMM. In addition, the Court ruled that
Texas Instruments had breached the patent portfolio license agreement, though
the breach was non-material, and

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">therefore Texas Instruments&#146; license under the
agreement would not be forfeited. The Court held a one-day bench trial on
August&nbsp;16, 2004, on the Company&#146;s claim that Texas Instruments breached the
agreement between the parties by pursuing the claims previously dismissed by
the Court. Although the Court had already found that the claims brought by
Texas Instruments were barred by the agreement, the Court declined to find that
bringing the claims constituted a breach of the agreement by Texas Instruments
and, therefore, found against the Company on the sole remaining claim in the
case. On October&nbsp;22, 2004, the Company filed a notice of appeal.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Conexant Systems, Inc. and Skyworks Solutions
Inc.</I>: On October&nbsp;8, 2002, the Company filed an action in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of California against Conexant and
Skyworks alleging infringement of five patents and misappropriation of trade
secrets and seeking damages and injunctive relief. On December&nbsp;4, 2003,
Skyworks answered and counterclaimed against QUALCOMM, alleging infringement of
four patents and misappropriation of trade secrets and seeking damages and
injunctive relief. On April&nbsp;30, 2004, the Court granted the Company&#146;s motion to
dismiss defendants&#146; inequitable conduct affirmative defenses and counterclaims.
The Company filed an amended complaint on June&nbsp;16, 2004, bringing the total
number of the Company&#146;s patents at issue to eight and maintaining the trade
secret misappropriation claim. On July&nbsp;16 and 20, 2004, Conexant and Skyworks
answered the Company&#146;s amended complaint, reasserted claims based on alleged
trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement and Skyworks also
asserted counterclaims alleging violations of antitrust laws and unfair
business practices. Conexant and Skyworks seek damages and other forms of
relief. On September&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company moved to stay the Skyworks antitrust
and related counterclaims. That motion is pending. The Company believes the
counterclaims are without merit. Claim construction hearings relating to the
patents in the case are under way. Discovery in the matter is continuing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.: </I>On December&nbsp;2,
2002, the Company filed an action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California against Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim)
alleging infringement of three patents and seeking damages and injunctive
relief. The Company has since amended the complaint, bringing the total number
of patents at issue to four. On May&nbsp;5, 2004, the Court granted Maxim&#146;s motion
that no indirect infringement arose in connection with defendants&#146; sales of
certain products to certain licensees of the Company. On June&nbsp;21, 2004, the
Court granted the Company&#146;s motion to stay all of Maxim&#146;s antitrust
counterclaims and its patent misuse defense. On July&nbsp;9, 2004, Maxim filed an
Answer and Counterclaims to the Company&#146;s Third Amended Complaint. Maxim&#146;s
amended counterclaims allege violation of antitrust laws and unfair business
practices and seek damages and other relief. The Company believes the amended
counterclaims are without merit and, if and when the Court&#146;s stay is lifted,
the Company will seek dismissal of those counterclaims as a matter of law.
Claim construction hearings relating to the patents in the case are under way.
Discovery in the matter is continuing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other: </I>The Company has been named, along with many other manufacturers of
wireless phones, wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a
defendant in purported class action lawsuits (In re Wireless Telephone
Frequency Emissions Products Liability Litigation, United States District Court
for the District of Maryland), and in several individually filed actions,
seeking personal injury, economic and/or punitive damages arising out of its
sale of cellular phones. On March&nbsp;5, 2003, the Court granted the defendants
motions to dismiss five of the consolidated cases (Pinney, Gimpleson, Gillian,
Farina and Naquin) on the grounds that the claims were preempted by federal
law. On April&nbsp;2, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this order
and the Court&#146;s order denying remand. All remaining cases filed against the
Company allege personal injury as a result of their use of a wireless
telephone. Those cases have been remanded to the Washington, D.C. Superior
Court. The courts that have reviewed similar claims against other companies to
date have held that there was insufficient scientific basis for the plaintiffs&#146;
claims in those cases.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the
foregoing matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
operating results, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the
claims are without merit and will vigorously defend the actions. The Company
has not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with the legal
proceedings described above based on the Company&#146;s belief that a liability,
while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be
estimated at this time. The Company is engaged in numerous other legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of its business and believes that the ultimate
outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its
operating results, liquidity or financial position.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under
noncancelable operating leases, with terms ranging from 2 to 10&nbsp;years and with
provisions for cost-of-living increases. Rental expense for fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $31&nbsp;million, $34&nbsp;million and $42&nbsp;million, respectively. Future
minimum lease payments in each of the next five years from fiscal 2005 through
2009 are $45&nbsp;million, $32&nbsp;million, $20&nbsp;million, $7&nbsp;million and $4&nbsp;million,
respectively, and $3&nbsp;million thereafter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Purchase Obligations</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase
inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets and estimates its
noncancelable obligations under these agreements to be approximately $885
million in fiscal 2005, $58&nbsp;million in fiscal 2006, $2&nbsp;million in fiscal 2007,
$2&nbsp;million in fiscal 2008 and $2&nbsp;million in fiscal 2009. Of these amounts,
commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories comprised $717
million in fiscal 2005 and $39&nbsp;million in fiscal 2006.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the financing commitments to Ericsson (Note 3) and the
Inquam guarantee commitment (Note 4), the Company had $1&nbsp;million of letters of

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">revenues and EBT for all prior periods have been
adjusted to reflect the reclassification of revenues and EBT related to these
consolidated investees to discontinued operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reorganized its
wholly-owned subsidiary SnapTrack, a developer of wireless position location
technology. The Company previously presented all of the revenues and operating
results of SnapTrack in the QCT segment. As a result of the reorganization of
SnapTrack, revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack&#146;s server
software business (software for computer servers that allows operators to offer
location-based services and applications) became part of the QIS division in
the QWI segment. Revenues and operating results related to SnapTrack&#146;s client
business (the gpsOne hybrid assisted global positioning system wireless
location technology that is embedded with the integrated circuit products)
remain with the QCT segment. Prior period segment information has been adjusted
to conform to the new segment presentation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company expects to
present the operating results of its wireless multimedia operator
subsidiary, MediaFLO USA, Inc.,
in the QSI segment. The development expenses related to the wireless multimedia operator business were included
in reconciling items through
the end of fiscal 2004. Also effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, the
Company expects to present the revenues and operating results of a QWI division
that develops and sells test tools to support the design, development, testing
and deployment of infrastructure and subscriber products in the QCT segment.
Prior periods will be restated to conform to the fiscal 2005 segment
presentation in future reports when the expected changes to the internal
reporting structure become effective.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings
(loss)&nbsp;before income taxes (EBT)&nbsp;from continuing operations, excluding certain
impairment and other charges that are not allocated to the segments for
management reporting purposes. EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate
expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense
related to unallocated corporate assets. Segment data includes intersegment
revenues.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, revenues between segments are based on prevailing market rates
for substantially similar products and services or an approximation thereof.
Certain charges are allocated to the corporate functional department in the
Company&#146;s management reports based on the decision that those charges should
not be used to evaluate the segments&#146; operating performance. Unallocated
charges include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, research
and development expenses and marketing expenses related to the development of
the CDMA market that were not deemed to be directly related to the businesses
of the segments.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segment assets are comprised of accounts receivable, finance receivables
and inventory for QCT, QTL and QWI. The QSI segment assets include marketable
securities, accounts receivable, finance receivables, notes receivable, other
investments and assets of consolidated investees. The QSI segment assets at
September&nbsp;30, 2003 and 2002 included $265&nbsp;million and $391&nbsp;million,
respectively, in assets related to discontinued operations (Note 11). Total
segment assets differ from total assets on a consolidated basis as a result of
unallocated corporate assets primarily comprised of cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities, property, plant and equipment, and goodwill. The net
book value of long-lived assets located outside of the United States was $21
million, $117&nbsp;million and $251&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were
primarily in Brazil at September&nbsp;20, 2003 and 2002 related to discontinued
operations (Note 11).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 11. Discontinued Operations in the QSI Segment</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal 1999, the Company acquired ownership interests in V&#233;sper S&#227;o
Paulo S.A. and V&#233;sper S.A. (the V&#233;sper Operating Companies). The V&#233;sper
Operating Companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide fixed
wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern, northeast and eastern
regions of Brazil and in the state of S&#227;o Paulo. In November&nbsp;2001, the Company
consummated a series of transactions resulting in an overall financial
restructuring of the V&#233;sper Operating Companies, which resulted in its holding
direct and indirect controlling ownership interests in the V&#233;sper Operating
Companies. As a result, the V&#233;sper Operating Companies were consolidated in the
Company&#146;s QSI segment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;2, 2003 (the Closing Date), Embratel Participa&#231;&#245;es S.A.
(Embratel) acquired the Company&#146;s direct and indirect ownership interests in
the V&#233;sper Operating Companies (the Embratel sale transaction) for no
consideration. The V&#233;sper Operating Companies&#146; existing communication towers
and related interests in tower site property leases (V&#233;sper Towers) were not
included in the Embratel sale transaction, and as such, the Company effectively
retained, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary (TowerCo), ownership and
control of the V&#233;sper Towers. The V&#233;sper Towers had a net book value of
approximately $5&nbsp;million on the Closing Date. Concurrent with the closing, the
V&#233;sper Operating Companies entered into a 10-year agreement (renewable at the
V&#233;sper Operating Companies&#146; option for up to two successive 5-year terms)
whereby the V&#233;sper Operating Companies would pay a
monthly fee to the Company for use of aerial and ground space on the tower
sites. The Company provided approximately $6&nbsp;million to fund operations of the
V&#233;sper Operating Companies during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 prior to
their sale and additionally provided approximately $39&nbsp;million in aggregate
funding to or for the benefit of the V&#233;sper Operating Companies on or before
the Closing Date to facilitate the Embratel sale transaction. Such funding
enabled the V&#233;sper Operating Companies to completely extinguish their existing
local bank debt (at an agreed discount) to allow the Company to retain
ownership of the V&#233;sper Towers free and clear of any local bank security
interest. The major classes of assets and liabilities sold in the Embratel sale
transaction included: $25&nbsp;million in accounts receivable, $5&nbsp;million in
inventory, $24&nbsp;million in other current assets, $95&nbsp;million in property, plant
and equipment, $6&nbsp;million in other assets, $52&nbsp;million in accounts payable, $5
million in payroll and other

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">benefits related liabilities, $6&nbsp;million in
unearned revenue, $1&nbsp;million in other current liabilities, $14&nbsp;million in
long-term debt and $3&nbsp;million in other liabilities. The Company realized a net
loss of $52&nbsp;million on the Embratel sale transaction during the first quarter
of fiscal 2004, including a $74&nbsp;million loss on the net assets sold to Embratel
and a $46&nbsp;million loss related to the recognition of cumulative foreign
currency translation losses previously included in stockholders&#146; equity,
partially offset by $68&nbsp;million in gains related to the extinguishment of local
bank debt and the settlement of other liabilities.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;19, 2002, the Company won bids to acquire personal mobile
service (SMP)&nbsp;licenses in certain regions of Brazil. Approximately $8&nbsp;million
of the approximate $82&nbsp;million purchase price for the SMP licenses was paid in
December&nbsp;2002. The remaining Brazilian real-denominated obligation was financed
by the Brazilian government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an
adjustment for inflation. These SMP licenses were not included in the Embratel
sale transaction. In December&nbsp;2003, the Company initiated a waiver and return
of the SMP licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in
Brazil. In February&nbsp;2004, the waiver and return of the SMP licenses was
approved by Anatel, and the license debt was extinguished. The Company realized
a net gain of $19&nbsp;million as a result of the removal of the $104&nbsp;million SMP
licenses and the related $123&nbsp;million debt and accrued interest during the
second quarter of fiscal 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;2, 2004, the Company sold TowerCo to Embratel in a separately
negotiated transaction (the TowerCo sale transaction) for $45&nbsp;million in cash.
TowerCo&#146;s assets were primarily comprised of $5&nbsp;million in property, plant and
equipment. The Company realized a net gain of $40&nbsp;million on the TowerCo sale
transaction during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result of the
disposition of the remaining operations and assets related to the V&#233;sper
Operating Companies, the Company determined that the results of operations and
cash flows related to the V&#233;sper Operating Companies, including the results
related to TowerCo and the SMP licenses and the gains and losses realized on
the Embratel and TowerCo sales transactions, should be presented as
discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations and cash
flows. The Company&#146;s statements of operations and cash flows for all prior
periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations. At September
30, 2004, the Company had no remaining assets or liabilities related to the

consolidated balance sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues of $36&nbsp;million, $123&nbsp;million and $125&nbsp;million were reported in
the loss from discontinued operations during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Pro forma results for fiscal 2002, assuming the acquisition of
the V&#233;sper Operating Companies had been made at the beginning of fiscal 2002,
are not presented because they would not differ materially from reported
results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 12. Auction Discount Voucher</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was awarded a $125&nbsp;million Auction Discount Voucher (ADV)&nbsp;by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&nbsp;in June&nbsp;2000 as the result of a
legal ruling. The ADV is fully transferable and may, subject to certain
conditions, be used in whole or in part by any entity in any FCC spectrum
auction over a period of three years, including those in which the Company is
not a participant. During November&nbsp;2002, the FCC amended the terms of the ADV
to allow the Company to use the ADV to satisfy existing FCC debt of other
companies. The FCC agreed to extend the ADV twice, most recently in June&nbsp;2004.
The ADV was scheduled to expire in September&nbsp;2004, but the Company used the
remaining ADV prior to its expiration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company used approximately $77&nbsp;million of the ADV&#146;s value prior to
fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $4&nbsp;million in other
operating income and $4&nbsp;million in selling, general and administrative expenses
in the QSI segment for cooperative marketing expenses incurred, with no effect
on net income, related to an arrangement under which a portion of the ADV was
transferred to a wireless operator prior to fiscal 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2004, the Company transferred approximately $18&nbsp;million of
the ADV&#146;s value to a wireless operator for approximately $17&nbsp;million in cash.
As a result of this transfer, the Company recorded an additional $17&nbsp;million in
other operating income in the QSI segment during fiscal 2004. The Company
recorded $47&nbsp;million in other income in the QSI segment during fiscal 2003
related to transfers of the ADV&#146;s value to wireless operators.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also used approximately $30&nbsp;million of the ADV during fiscal
2004 as final payment for wireless licenses granted in fiscal 2004 in which the
Company was the highest bidder in a FCC auction held during fiscal 2003. On a
cumulative basis, the Company used $38&nbsp;million of the ADV as payment for these
wireless licenses, for

approximately $160&nbsp;million in cash and the exchange of stock options with an
aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $17&nbsp;million. Also in October
2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Trigenix Limited, a privately
