</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication technique called CDMA
could be commercially successful in wireless communication applications. CDMA stands for Code
Division Multiple Access and is one of the main technologies currently used in digital wireless
communications networks (also known as wireless networks). CDMA and GSM (which is a form of TDMA
and stands for Global System for Mobile Communications) are the primary digital technologies used
to transmit a wireless device user&#146;s voice or data over radio waves using the wireless network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we led, and continue to lead, the development and commercialization of CDMA
technology, we own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and
trade secrets, which applies to all versions of CDMA and portions of which we license to other
companies and implement in our own products. The wireless communications industry generally
recognizes that a company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA
technology will require a patent license from us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several versions of CDMA technology recognized worldwide as public cellular
standards. The first version, known as cdmaOne, is a second generation (2G) cellular technology
that was first commercially deployed in the mid-1990s. The other subsequent versions of CDMA are
popularly referred to as third generation (3G) technologies known commonly throughout the wireless
industry as:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDMA2000 and WCDMA are deployed today in wireless networks throughout the world. In addition
to increasing voice capacity, these 3G CDMA technologies enable greater data capacity at higher
data rates. In the future, we expect a broader range of airlinks will be utilized depending on the
spectrum availability and applications offered by each wireless network operator (also known as
wireless operator). These include WCDMA upgrades beyond HSPA&#043; (called Long Term Evolution (LTE)),
CDMA2000 upgrades beyond 1xEV-DO Revisions A and B (called Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB)), an
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA)/CDMA upgrade path for ultra mobile
broadband data rates using up to 20 MHz channels in new spectrum and other OFDMA-based

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WCDMA has been commercially deployed by more than 180 operators worldwide, as reported by the
Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), an international organization of WCDMA and GSM
suppliers, in its October&nbsp;2007 reports. The WCDMA family includes HSDPA, part of 3<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">rd</SUP>
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 5, which was first deployed commercially in December
2005 in the United States using our chipsets; as well as, HSUPA, part of 3GPP Release 6, which was
deployed commercially in 2007. We expect enhancements in future revisions of the 3GPP
specifications will further increase performance capacity and data speeds. We expect many WCDMA
operators to eventually upgrade their networks to HSUPA. More than 140 operators have launched
commercial HSDPA networks and 19 operators have launched HSUPA, as reported by the GSA in October
2007. Another 3G technology, TD-SCDMA, is being deployed in China along with CDMA2000, and WCDMA is
being considered for deployment.

(3GPP Release 6), HSPA&#043; (3GPP Release 7) and other future standards. These technologies support
more efficient voice communications, broadband access to the Internet, multimedia services, VoIP
and other delay sensitive applications (including video telephony, push-to-talk and multiplayer
gaming) and other revenue-generating services, in turn accelerating the growth of CDMA. At the same
time, we are working to fulfill the growing demand for affordable, voice-centric CDMA wireless
devices within the emerging entry-level market through various efforts including the introduction
of Single Chip (SC)&nbsp;solutions, streamlined test and certification processes and the aggregation of
device procurements. With regard to our 1xEV-DO technology, we have improved its value, performance
and economics with EV-DO Revision A, which provides a number of enhancements, including greater
spectral efficiency, faster reverse-link data rates, lower latency and optimized quality of
service. EV-DO Revision B enables CDMA operators to utilize a software upgrade to allow multiple RF
operators to transmit to a single device and hence significantly increase the user data rates (e.g.
three times in a 5 MHz bandwidth) and reduce latency for bursty applications.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we continue to contribute to 3GPP2 and 3GPP standards to enable the next level
of mobile broadband data services. In April&nbsp;2007, 3GPP2 published the first version of UMB (Ultra
Mobile Broadband), an OFDMA-based specification. UMB is a broadband air interface using primarily
OFDMA, but also incorporating CDMA, providing data rates up to 152 Mbps on the downlink with and 75
Mbps on the uplink with two base station antennas and two handset antennas using the 20 MHz
bandwidth. With the same bandwidths and with four antennas at both the base station and device,
downlink rates greater than 288 Mpbs can be obtained. The data rates will be less with lower
bandwidths. 3GPP standards are also evolving beyond current HSDPA and HSUPA through Release 7 and
Release 8 to offer Evolved HSPA (High Speed Packet Access), also known as HSPA&#043;, technologies to
enable much higher broadband data rates and higher capacity voice services. In parallel, 3GPP is
also introducing an OFDMA-based air-interface through its LTE standard to deliver higher mobile
broadband data rates using channel bandwidths up to 20 MHz. These standards also enable end-to-end
Internet Protocol (IP)&nbsp;transport using advanced IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)&nbsp;platform to deliver
voice (VoIP), multimedia and other broadband data services cost effectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UMB and LTE have been proposed to be part of the International Telecommunications Union
IMT-2000 specification as part of the normal update process. WiMax has been proposed to be
the sixth air interface in the IMT-2000 family. Initial systems utilizing 802.16e WiMax standard
are expected to be commercialized in the 2008 time frame. These systems are targeted at TDD
spectrum and higher frequency bands (e.g. 2.5 and 3.5 GHz). Similarly, WiBRO, a variant of WiMax,
has been deployed in South Korea at 2.3 GHz with limited commercial success. Since the WiMax family
of standards has evolved from a wire line legacy, we believe that, in the near future, the
efficiency and mobility are not expected to be as robust as those technologies that were designed
from the ground up for mobile broadband (i.e. UMB and LTE). Furthermore, the 3G economies of scale
greatly improve the availability and cost structure of 3GPP and 3GPP2 evolved technologies. The
OFDMA family of standards is expected to be complementary with 3G services, and Qualcomm expects to
provide multimode chipsets capable of operating across multiple technology deployment scenarios.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of
their existing services, offer these services more affordably, and introduce revenue-generating
broadband data services ahead of their competition. Our patented technologies, resulting from our
strong investment in fundamental system research and development, have been and are expected to
continue to play a significant role in each of these future standards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi, are complementary to Wide Area Networks
(WAN), such as CDMA2000 and WCDMA. They both provide affordable high-speed wireless access to the
Internet. The limited coverage offered by Wi-Fi is well suited for private networks (e.g.
enterprises, campuses and homes) and certain public &#147;hot spots&#148; (e.g. airports, conference halls
and coffee shops) where data usage is high in a limited portable and stationary environment. 3G
CDMA networks, on the other hand, are ideally suited for geographically diverse voice and data
coverage (e.g. cities, highways and neighborhoods) and in environments where public access to the
Wi-Fi network is blocked due to a firewall (e.g. a client&#146;s enterprise). We may incorporate WLAN
technology into our future multimode 3G CDMA chipsets as we continue to identify and integrate
other complementary wireless technologies into our chipsets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing our MediaFLO MDS and OFDM-based FLO technology to optimize the low cost
delivery of multimedia content to multiple wireless subscribers simultaneously, otherwise known as
multicasting. As part of the standardization of FLO technology, the FLO Forum (www.floforum.org)
was established in May&nbsp;2005. To date, more than 85 companies have joined the FLO Forum. In 2005,
the TIA established a Committee to develop standards for Terrestrial Mobile Multimedia Multicast.
In August&nbsp;2006, TIA published the Standard Forward Link Only Air Interface Specification based upon
the FLO Forum&#146;s submissions, thus standardizing the lower layers of the FLO air interface. The TIA
has published a total of five standards relating to the MediaFLO MDS technology and several other
standards are currently in development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are also developing our interferometric modulator (IMOD)&nbsp;display technology based on a
micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS)&nbsp;structure combined with thin film optics. The IMOD display
technology may be included in the full range of consumer-targeted mobile products and is expected
to provide performance, power consumption and cost benefits as compared to current display
technologies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the tremendous demand for wireless voice services, wireless service providers
are increasingly focused on providing broadband wireless access to the Internet, as well as
multimedia entertainment, messaging, mobile commerce and position location services. These services
have been aided by the development and commercialization of 3G wireless networks and 3G handsets
which are capable of supporting higher data rates that
incorporate an ever-increasing array of new features and functionality, such as assisted
GPS-based position location, digital cameras with flash and zoom capabilities, internet browsers,
email, interactive games, music and video downloads and software download capability (e.g. our BREW
platform). In October&nbsp;2007, the Yankee Group, a global market intelligence and advisory firm in the
technology and telecommunications industries, estimated that more than 2.5&nbsp;billion people will be
using mobile data services by 2011 and the revenue produced from these services will account for
23% of total service revenue worldwide. We believe the growing availability of 3G-enabled handsets
capable of performing a wide variety of consumer and enterprise applications will accelerate the
demand for many wireless data services on a global basis and thus lead to an increased replacement
rate of mobile

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">devices to those using our technologies and integrated circuits. Affordable wireless
broadband data connectivity is important to the consumer and enterprise, and its demand will
continue to drive the evolution of wireless standards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of wireless standards for mobile communications within individual countries is
generally determined by the telecommunication service providers operating in those countries and,
in some instances, local government regulations. Such determinations are typically based on
economic criteria and the service provider&#146;s evaluation of each technology&#146;s ability to provide the
features and functionality required for its business plan. More than a decade and a half ago, the
European Community developed regulations requiring the use of a telecommunication standard known as
Global System for Mobile Communications, commonly referred to as GSM, a TDMA-based technology.
According to Wireless Intelligence, the use of this second generation wireless standard has spread
throughout the world and is currently the basis for approximately 80% of the digital mobile
communications in use. With the deployment of WCDMA, a third generation CDMA-based technology, by
GSM operators, many of the current 2.5&nbsp;billion GSM subscribers are expected to upgrade to third
generation wireless services and are enjoying the added features and functionality available with
3G systems. For instance, a worldwide forecast published by Strategy Analytics in July&nbsp;2007
indicated that the total number of WCDMA (UMTS)&nbsp;subscribers will grow from 190&nbsp;million at the end
of 2007 to over 1&nbsp;billion by the beginning of 2012.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant growth in the use of wireless devices worldwide and demand for enhanced
network functionality requires constant innovation to further improve network reliability, expand
capacity and introduce new types of services. To meet these requirements, progressive generations
of wireless telecommunications technology standards have evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Second Generation. </I></B>Compared to first generation analog systems, second generation digital
technology provided for significantly enhanced efficiency within a fixed spectrum resulting in
greatly increased voice capacity. Second generation technologies also enabled numerous enhanced
services, including paging, e-mail, facsimile, connections to computer networks, greater privacy,
lower prices, a greater number of service options and greater fraud protection. However, data
services (email, fax, computer connections) were generally limited to low speed transmission rates.
The main second-generation digital cellular technologies are called cdmaOne or IS-95A/B, a
technology we developed and patented, North American TDMA, PDC (Personal Digital Cellular&#151;a
variant of North American TDMA), and GSM, also a form of TDMA. At
this time, sales of North American TDMA
and PDC phones have been discontinued with subscribers being moved to GSM or 3G technologies. Many
operators have plans to shut down usage of these second generation systems. Similarly, analog
systems have been shut down in many places. In the United States, the FCC is permitting operators
to shut down the analog system beginning in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Third Generation. </I></B>As a result of demand for wireless networks that simultaneously carry both
high speed data and voice traffic, in May&nbsp;2000, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a
standards setting organization, adopted the 3G standard known as IMT-2000, which encompasses five
terrestrial operating radio interfaces, three of them based on our CDMA intellectual property. The
other two are TDMA-based.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advantages of 3G CDMA technology over both analog and TDMA- and GSM-based
technologies include increased network capacity, network flexibility, compatibility with internet
protocols, higher capacity for data and faster access to data
(Internet) and higher data throughput
rates. GSM has the benefits of roaming due to its wider worldwide
deployment Once considered an advantage of GSM, several low priced handsets of
approximately $30 or less are available today for CDMA, further enabling wireless CDMA growth in
developing regions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
current commercial versions of CDMA2000, CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO, provide both voice and high-speed wireless data communications. CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO utilize the
same standard channel bandwidth as existing cdmaOne systems and, as a result, are compatible with
wireless telecommunications operators&#146; existing network equipment, making the migration to 3G
simple and affordable. We believe CDMA2000 1X provides approximately twice the voice capacity of
cdmaOne and six to eight times that of TDMA-based networks. Position location technology,
accomplished through a hybrid approach that utilizes signals from both the GPS satellite
constellation and CDMA cell sites, enables CDMA system operators to meet the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC)&nbsp;mandate requiring wireless operators to implement E911 wireless emergency location
services and offer other commercial location-based services. In the future, updates of CDMA2000 1X
and 1xEV-DO are expected to further increase performance. Other enhancements, such as multicast
services, higher-resolution displays, longer battery life, push-to-talk services and VoIP are
becoming available to improve the user experience and operator profitability. The price
differential between low-end third generation CDMA2000 handsets and GSM handsets is diminishing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GSM operators around the world, including those in the European Community and AT&#038;T in the
United States, have focused primarily on the UTRA-FDD radio interface of the IMT-2000 standard,
known as WCDMA, which is based on our underlying CDMA technology and incorporates many of our
patented inventions (as are all of the CDMA radio interfaces of the IMT-2000 Standard). The
majority of the world&#146;s leading wireless device and infrastructure manufacturers (more than 85)
have licensed our technology for use in WCDMA products, enabling them to utilize this WCDMA mode of
the 3G technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of GSM operators deployed 2.5G mobile packet data technologies, such
as GPRS and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) in areas serviced by GSM, as a bridging
technology, while they waited for 3G WCDMA devices to become more readily available and affordable
so they can justify the expense of upgrading their GSM system to provide WCDMA service. In some
regions of the world, regulatory restrictions have prevented deploying WCDMA in the lower frequency
bands used by GSM, thus requiring more cell sites for WCDMA to provide coverage. As a result, in
less dense areas, some operators have not deployed
WCDMA. From a technological perspective, we do not believe that GPRS and EDGE effectively
compete with 3G CDMA-based packet data services, either on a cost per bit or transmitted
performance basis. The European Union permitted IMT-2000 technologies, which include WCDMA, to be
deployed in the lower frequency 900 MHz band. This is called UMTS900. As a result, commercial
deployments are expected, and there have been announcements from vendors indicating they will
provide UMTS900 equipment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three ITU 3G CDMA radio interfaces are all based on the underlying core principles of CDMA
technology; however, the CDMA2000 mode enables a direct and more economical conversion for current
cdmaOne networks. While the WCDMA wireless air interface does use CDMA technology for
communications between the wireless device and the network, the infrastructure backhaul network has
been specifically designed to be compatible with the GSM backhaul network, which is why GSM
operators will migrate to WCDMA rather than to CDMA2000<B>. </B>Our intellectual property rights include a
valuable patent portfolio essential to implementation of each of the 3G CDMA alternative standards
and patents that are useful for commercially successful product implementations. Generally, we have
licensed substantially all of our patents to our CDMA subscriber and
infrastructure equipment licensees. Under each of our existing license
agreements covering multiple CDMA standards, the royalty rate paid to us for sales of licensed 3G
CDMA (regardless of whether it is CDMA2000, WCDMA, TD-CDMA or TD-SCDMA) subscriber products is no
less than the rate that such licensee pays for its licensed second generation cdmaOne subscriber
products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 3G CDMA versions (CDMA2000, WCDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) from a technological
perspective require separate implementations and are not interchangeable. While the fundamental
core technologies are derived from CDMA and, in addition to other features and functionality, are
covered by our patents, they each require unique infrastructure products, network design and
management. However, subscriber roaming amongst systems using different air interfaces is made
possible through multimode wireless devices.

foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made.
Integrated circuits are die, cut from silicon wafers, that have completed the assembly and final
test manufacturing processes. Die, cut from silicon wafers, are the essential components of all of
our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We rely on
independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the

of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and
two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our
foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits.
Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase completed die directly from
semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract directly with third party manufacturers for
back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as
Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). Our fabless model provides us the flexibility to select

changes, we anticipate that additional competitors will enter this market. We believe that the
principal competitive factors for CDMA integrated circuit providers to our addressed markets are
product performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry standards, price,
time-to-market, system cost, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and
customer support. The specific bases on which we compete against alternative CDMA integrated
circuit providers vary by product platform. We also compete in both single and dual-mode
environments against alternative wireless communications technologies including, but not limited
to, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, TDMA, WiMax and analog.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s current competitors include major semiconductor companies such as Freescale, Infineon,
NEC, Philips, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom, as well as major
telecommunication equipment companies such as Ericsson, Matsushita, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung,
who design their own integrated circuits and software for certain products. QCT also faces
competition from some start-up ventures. Our competitors may devote significantly greater amounts
of their financial, technical and other resources to market competitive telecommunications systems
or to develop and adopt competitive digital cellular technologies, and those efforts may materially
and adversely affect QCT. Moreover, competitors may offer more attractive product pricing or

intellectual property for sale to CDMA-based wireless device manufacturers. In exchange for these
rights, we are entitled to receive fees, royalties (determined as a percentage of the selling price
of the integrated circuits) and/or royalty-free cross-licenses, which allow us to use these
companies&#146; CDMA and, in some cases, non-CDMA intellectual property for specified purposes. In every
case, the wireless device manufacturers&#146; sales of CDMA-based wireless subscriber devices are

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have numerous competitors for each of our BREW products and services. These competitors are
continuing to develop their products with a focus on client provisioning, user interface, content
distribution and billing products and services. Competitors are attempting to offer value added
products and services similar, in many cases, to our existing or developing BREW technologies. In
some cases, competitors attempt to displace only
certain components or areas of the greater BREW offering, such as only the runtime
client/device environment portion of BREW. Certain competitors in the computing and device
manufacturing industries are attempting to replicate the entire BREW system offering, including
both runtime device environments and billing/distribution systems. Similarly, some operators are

position but at this time most, if not all, companies recognize that any company seeking to
develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technologies will require a patent license
from us. Notwithstanding the strength of this intellectual property position, we have succeeded in
licensing our technologies to interested companies on terms that are fair, reasonable and free from
unfair discrimination. Unlike some other companies in our industry that hold back certain key
technologies, we offer interested companies the opportunity to license essentially our entire

as ongoing royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of certain
permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.), of subscriber and
infrastructure equipment. License fees are paid in one or more installments, while royalties
generally continue throughout the life of the licensed patents. We believe that our royalty rates
are reasonable and fair to the companies that benefit from our intellectual property and provide
significant incentives for others to invest in CDMA (including WCDMA) applications, as evidenced by
the significant growth in the CDMA portion of the wireless industry and the number of CDMA

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this
Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described
below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the
following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case,
the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information
set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>If deployment of our technologies does not expand as expected, our revenues may not grow as
anticipated.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus our business primarily on developing, patenting and commercializing CDMA technology
for wireless telecommunications applications. In addition, with the acquisition of Flarion, we have
increased our emphasis on developing, patenting and commercializing OFDMA technology. Other digital
wireless communications technologies, particularly GSM technology, have been more widely deployed
than CDMA technology. OFDMA has not been widely deployed commercially. Notwithstanding our
portfolio of OFDM/OFDMA intellectual property, technology and products, if CDMA technology does not
become the preferred wireless communications industry standard in the countries where our products
and those of our customers and licensees are sold, our business and financial results could suffer.
If GSM wireless operators do not select CDMA for their networks or update their current networks to
any CDMA-based third generation (3G) technology, our business and financial results could suffer
since we generally have not generated revenues from GSM product sales. Further, if OFDMA technology
is not adopted and deployed commercially, our investments in OFDMA technology may not provide us an
adequate return.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business and the deployment of our technologies, products and services are dependent on
the success of our customers, licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators, as well as the timing of
their deployment of new services. Our licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators may incur lower
operating margins on products or services based on our technologies than on products using
alternative technologies as a result of greater competition in the relevant market or other
factors. If CDMA-based wireless operators, wireless device and/or infrastructure manufacturers exit
the CDMA-based markets, the deployment of CDMA technology could be negatively affected, and our
business could suffer.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>We are dependent on the commercial deployment of 3G wireless communications equipment, products and
services to increase our revenues, and our business may be harmed if wireless networks deploy other
technologies.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase our revenues in future periods, we are dependent upon the commercial deployment of
3G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA technology. Although
wireless network operators have commercially deployed CDMA2000 and WCDMA, we cannot predict the
timing or success of further commercial deployments or expansions of CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA
systems. If existing deployments are not commercially successful or do not continue to grow their
subscriber base, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA-based systems
are delayed or unsuccessful, our business and financial results may be harmed. In addition, our
business could be harmed if wireless network operators deploy other technologies or switch existing
networks from CDMA to GSM without upgrading to WCDMA or if wireless

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">network operators introduce new technologies. A limited number of operators have started testing OFDMA technology, but OFDMA might
not be adopted or deployed commercially and we might not be successful in developing and marketing
OFDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Our patent portfolio may not be as successful in generating licensing income with respect to other
technologies as it has been for CDMA-based technologies.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to GPRS, EDGE,
OFDM, OFDMA and MIMO technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in these areas is less
established and might not be as successful in generating licensing income as our CDMA portfolio
licensing program. Sprint Nextel has indicated that it is planning to deploy WiMax (an OFDMA-based
technology) in its 2.5 GHz spectrum, also known as the Broadband Radio Services band. Other
operators are investigating deployment of WiMax. Other operators are considering LTE, being
standardized by 3GPP, or UMB, being standardized by 3GPP2, as next generation technologies for
deployment in existing or future spectrum bands. Although we believe that our patented technology
is essential and useful to implementation of the WiMax, LTE or UMB standards, we might not achieve
the same royalty revenue on such WiMax, LTE or UMB deployments as on CDMA/WCDMA, and we might not
achieve the same chipset market shares within a WiMax, LTE or UMB network.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Our three largest customers accounted for 41% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 39% in
fiscal 2006 and 2005. The loss of any one of our major customers or any reduction in the demand for
devices utilizing our CDMA technology could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or
sustain desired levels of operating results.</I>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of any one of our QCT segment&#146;s significant customers or the delay, even if only
temporary, or cancellation of significant orders from any of these customers would reduce our
revenues in the period of the cancellation or deferral and harm our ability to achieve or sustain
expected levels of operating results. We derive a significant portion of our QCT segment revenues from three major customers. Accordingly,
unless and until our QCT segment diversifies and expands its customer base, our future success will
significantly depend upon the timing and size of any future purchase orders from these customers.
Factors that may impact the size and timing of orders from customers of our QCT segment include,
among others, the following:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only
patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date, and, in a small number of
agreements, royalties are payable on those patents for a specified time period. As a result, there
are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us under our
license agreements. In order to license any such later patents, we will need to extend or modify
our license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We might not be
able to modify such license agreements in the future to license any such later patents or extend
such date(s) to incorporate later patents without affecting the material terms and conditions of
our license agreements with such licensees. In particular, we are party to an ongoing arbitration
with Nokia Corp. relating to Nokia&#146;s continued sales after April&nbsp;9, 2007 of products that
incorporate certain Qualcomm patents. One of our contentions in that proceeding (which Nokia
disputes) is that such use of our patents resulted in an extension of the license agreement, which
also extends our rights to sell integrated circuits under Nokia&#146;s patents. We might not prevail in
such arbitration. If we do not prevail, Nokia&#146;s right to sell certain subscriber products (such as
cellular phones, wireless personal digital assistant and other devices) under most of our patents
(including many that we have declared as potentially essential to the CDMA, WCDMA and other standards), and therefore Nokia&#146;s
obligation to pay royalties to us under the terms of the current agreement, may both cease, and our
rights under certain of Nokia&#146;s patents to sell integrated circuits under the terms of the current
agreement may likewise cease. If we do not prevail, and the arbitration panel does not find Nokia
to have extended the license agreement, the above rights could be extended if Nokia expressly
elects to extend the agreement beyond April&nbsp;9, 2007, a right that is exercisable through December
31, 2008 unless earlier terminated.

governments that harm our business.</I>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small number of companies have initiated various strategies in an attempt to renegotiate,
mitigate and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual
property in order to negatively affect our business model and that of our other licensees. These
strategies have included (i)&nbsp;litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such
companies or unfair competition of some variety, (ii)&nbsp;taking questionable positions on the
interpretation of contracts with us, with royalty reduction as the likely true motive, (iii)
appeals to governmental authorities, such as the complaints filed with the European Commission (EC)
during the fourth calendar quarter of 2005 and with the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC)&nbsp;and the
Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC)&nbsp;during 2006, and (iv)&nbsp;lobbying with governmental regulators and
elected officials for the purpose of seeking the imposition of some form of compulsory licensing
and/or to weaken a patent holder&#146;s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such
rights. A number of these strategies are purportedly based on
interpretations of the polices of certain standards development
organizations concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be
essential to industry standards and our alleged failure to abide by
these policies.

Panasonic, Texas Instruments, Broadcom and NEC) submitted separate formal complaints accusing our
business practices, with respect to licensing of patents and sales of chipsets, to be in violation
of Article&nbsp;82 of the EC treaty. We received the complaints, have submitted a response and have
cooperated with the EC in its investigation. On October&nbsp;1, 2007, the EC announced that it has

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products and technologies is
difficult and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the
misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly
in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or as readily
as United States laws. We cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country, including
the United States, or the practices of any of the standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with
respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing, issuance of wireless licenses or the
adoption of standards, will not be changed in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the
sale or use of our products or technology. Recent decisions from the United States courts relating
to patents may affect the ability to enforce patent rights. Within the United States Senate and
House of Representatives, committee work has progressed to draft a &#147;patent reform law,&#148; with the
House and Senate committees each having reported a different draft bill to the full House and
Senate, respectively. The full House has adopted its committee&#146;s draft bill. The end product of
such work could be new patent legislation detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or
use of our products or technology. Any efforts we make to inform and educate policymakers about the
effects of such potential changes may absorb significant management time and attention, which, in
turn, could negatively impact our operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of our patents and patent applications relate to our wireless communications
technology and much of the remainder of our patents and patent applications relate to our other
technologies and products. We may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights,
protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a
result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights to one or more patents or incur
substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our intellectual property
rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn,
could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights
could impair our brand identity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, that patents on which we

intellectual proprietary rights against our products or products using our technologies or other
technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our
involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues
and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found
to infringe on another company&#146;s intellectual property rights, we could be required to redesign our
products, which could be costly, or license such rights and/or pay damages or other compensation to
such other company. If we were unable to redesign our products or license such intellectual

markets not currently deploying CDMA-based wireless communications technology. These competitors
also may have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or
with our existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may
affect our customers&#146; decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly,
new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market
share to our detriment. In addition to the foregoing, we have seen, and believe we will continue to
see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including chipsets, that will
operate in an &#147;open source&#148; environment. Developing open source compliant products, without

display market is currently, and we believe will likely continue to be for some time, dominated by
displays based on liquid crystal display (LCD)&nbsp;technology. Numerous companies are making
substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics of LCDs.
Additionally, several other flat panel display technologies have been, or are being, developed,
including technologies for the production of organic light-emitting diode (OLED), field emission,
inorganic electroluminescence, gas plasma and vacuum fluorescent displays. In each case, advances
in LCD or other flat panel display technologies could result in technologies that are more cost
effective, have fewer display limitations, or can be brought to market faster than our IMOD

aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all essential patents owned by all of
the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant

each member company with essential patents based upon the size of its essential patent portfolio.
Although the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)&nbsp;ad hoc IPR group and the Next
Generation Mobile Network industry group have thus far determined that such proposals should not be
adopted as amendments to existing ETSI policies or new policies, such proposals as
described above might be revisited by ETSI and might be adopted by other SDO&#146;s or industry

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QMT Division. </I>QMT needs to form and maintain reliable business relationships with flat panel
display manufacturers or other targeted partners to support the manufacture of IMOD displays in
commercial volumes. All of our current relationships have been for the development and limited
production of certain IMOD display panels and/or modules. Some or all of these relationships may
not succeed or, even if they are successful, may not result in the display manufacturers&#146; entering
into material supply relationships with us.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>We have expanded our QCT segment&#146;s manufacturing model to include the purchase of completed die
from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and to contract directly with third party manufacturers
for assembly and test services. This new production model may increase costs and lower our control
over the manufacturing process.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further enable flexibility of supply and access to potential new foundry suppliers, and in
response to the complexity of our product roadmap, starting in fiscal 2005, we expanded our
manufacturing model to include purchasing completed die directly from semiconductor manufacturing
foundries. Under our Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM)&nbsp;model, we contract directly with third
party manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services, and we ship the completed integrated
circuits to our customers. We expect to increase the volume of our purchases of completed die
directly from our foundry suppliers under our IFM model as we source new products and convert
existing turnkey production to our IFM model. We are unable to directly control the services
provided by our semiconductor assembly and test (SAT)&nbsp;suppliers, including the timely procurement
of packaging materials for our products, availability of assembly and test capacity, quality
assurance and product delivery schedules. We have a limited history of working with the SAT
suppliers under this expanded manufacturing model, and cannot guarantee that this change and our
lack of control will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet
our delivery obligations to our customers, reduce our revenue, or increase our cost of sales.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Our suppliers may also be our competitors putting us at a disadvantage for pricing and capacity
allocation.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more of our suppliers may obtain licenses from us to manufacture CDMA-based integrated
circuits that compete with our products. In this event, the supplier could elect to allocate raw
materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce deliveries to us to our
detriment. In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms. We
cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations
that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost
of sales.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant part of our strategy involves our continued pursuit of growth opportunities in a
number of international markets. We market, sell and service our products internationally. We have
established sales offices around the world. We expect to continue to expand our international sales
operations and enter new international markets. This expansion will require significant management
attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and indirect international sales
and support channels, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures
in this effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. If we are not able to maintain
or increase international market demand for our products and technologies, we may not be able to
maintain a desired rate of growth in our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our international customers sell their products to markets throughout the world, including
China, India, Japan, South Korea, North America, South America and Europe. We distinguish revenues
from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software
or services are delivered and, for QTL&#146;s licensing and royalty revenue, the domicile of our
licensees. Consolidated revenues from international customers as a percentage of total revenues
were 87% in fiscal 2007 and 2006 and 82% in fiscal 2005. Because most of our foreign sales are
denominated in U.S. dollars, our products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold in
U.S. dollars become less price-competitive in international markets if the value of the U.S. dollar
increases relative to foreign currencies, and our revenues may not
grow as quickly as they otherwise might in response to worldwide growth
in wireless products and services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many international markets, barriers to entry are created by long-standing relationships
between our potential customers and their local service providers and protective regulations,
including local content and service requirements. In addition, our pursuit of international growth
opportunities may require significant investments for

particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and wireless network operators. We
cannot predict negative events, such as war, that may have adverse effects on the economy or on
wireless device inventories at CDMA-based equipment manufacturers and operators. The continued
threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any
future acts of terrorism, may cause disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless
communications industry and create uncertainties. Recent reports suggest that inflation could have
adverse effects on the global economy and capital markets. Inflation and/or deflation and economic
recessions could adversely affect our customers, including their ability to obtain financing,
upgrade wireless networks and purchase our products and services, and our end consumers, by
lowering their standards of living and diminishing their ability to purchase wireless devices based
on our technology. Inflation could also increase our costs of raw materials and operating expenses
and harm our business in other ways. During fiscal 2007, 69% of our revenues were from customers
and licensees based in South Korea, Japan and China, as compared to 70% and 69% during fiscal 2006
and 2005, respectively. These customers sell their products to markets worldwide, including Japan,
South Korea, China, India, North America, South America and Europe. A significant downturn in the
economies of Asian countries where many of our customers and licensees are located, particularly
the economies of South Korea, Japan and China, or the economies of the major markets they serve

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only
when the products are in use. For example, as our chipset product complexities increase, we are
required to migrate to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes. The
design process interface issues are more complex as we enter into these new domains of technology,
which adds risk to yields and reliability. Because our products and services are responsible for
critical functions in our customers&#146; products and/or networks, such defects or errors could have a
serious impact on our customers, which could damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships
and expose us to liability. Defects or impurities in our components, materials or software or those
used by our customers or licensees, equipment failures or other difficulties could adversely affect
our ability and that of our customers and licensees to ship products on a timely basis as well as
customer or licensee demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or declines in demand could
reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain desired levels of profitability. We
and our customers or licensees may also experience component or software failures or defects that
could require significant product recalls, reworks and/or repairs that are not covered by warranty
reserves and which could consume a substantial portion of the capacity of our third party
manufacturers or those of our customers or licensees. Resolving any defect or failure related
issues could consume financial and/or engineering resources that could affect future product
release schedules. Additionally, a defect or failure in our products or the products of our
customers or licensees could harm our reputation and/or adversely affect the growth of 3G wireless
markets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our products and those of our licensees and

to access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system software in those devices to
viral or malicious attacks. We continue to expand our focus on this issue and take measures to
safeguard the software from this threat. However, this issue carries the risk of general product
liability claims along with the associated impacts on reputation and demand. Although we carry
product liability insurance to protect against product liability claims, we cannot assure you that
our insurance coverage will be sufficient to protect us against losses due to product liability claims, or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MediaFLO business is a wholesale provider of mobile entertainment and information services
to our operator partners. As such, we do not set the retail price of our service to the consumer,
nor do we directly control the marketing and promotion of the service to the operator&#146;s subscriber
base. Therefore, we are dependent upon our operator partners to price, market and otherwise promote
our services to the end users. If our operator partners do not effectively price, market and
otherwise promote the service to their subscriber base, our ability to achieve the subscriber and
revenue targets contemplated in our business plan will be negatively impacted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer acceptance of the services our MediaFLO businesses offer is, and will continue to be,
affected by technology-based differences and by the operational performance, quality, reliability
and coverage of our wireless network. Consumer demand could be impacted by differences in
technology, coverage and service areas, network quality, consumer perceptions, media content
offerings and rate plans. Our operator partners may have difficulty retaining subscribers if we are
unable to meet our customers&#146; expectations for network quality and coverage, customer care or
content. Obtaining content that is appealing to subscribers on economically rational terms may be
limited by pre-existing exclusivity agreements content providers have with their customers as well
as limitations placed on some content with respect to rights for mobile programming. An inability
to address those issues could limit our ability to expand our subscriber base and place us at a
competitive disadvantage as well as affect our ability to attract new subscribers. Additionally,
adoption and deployment of our MediaFLO technology could be adversely impacted by government
regulatory practices that support a single standard other than our technology, operator selection of
competing technologies or consumer preferences.

resources. In order to manage growth and geographic expansion, we must continue to improve and
develop our management, operational and financial systems and controls, including quality control
and delivery and service capabilities. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our
employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and
inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology
transitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand

our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation
could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and
accruals. In such case, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period
or periods in which that determination is made could result. In addition, tax rules may change that
may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For
example, we consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be
invested indefinitely outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash
generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for
United States federal and state or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our future reported financial results may be
adversely affected if tax or accounting rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change or if
domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless
networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry
and adversely affect our business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that
utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators
must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in
the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated
to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital
required to: obtain licenses to use new frequencies; deploy wireless networks to offer voice and
data services; expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services; and obtain new
subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow
the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional
capital necessary to implement or expand 3G wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely
affected if this occurs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>If wireless devices pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our
products and those of our licensees and customers may decrease.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect
of discouraging the use of wireless devices, which would decrease demand for our products and those
of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have
updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio
equipment, including wireless phones and other wireless devices. In addition, interest groups have
requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health
concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also
been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the
use of wireless devices while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these
expressions of concern could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and
customers in the United States as well as foreign countries.

unavailability or nonperformance of these network systems could harm our business. The products and
services that we sell for use on Globalstar Inc.&#146;s (Globalstar) low-Earth-orbit satellite network
are dependent on the availability and performance of the Globalstar satellite system. On February
6, 2007, Globalstar announced that many Globalstar satellites are experiencing an anomaly resulting
in degraded performance of the amplifiers for the S-band satellite communications antenna.
Globalstar stated that unless remedied, by some time in 2008, this degradation or degraded
performance will have a significant adverse impact on Globalstar&#146;s ability to provide uninterrupted
two-way voice and data services on a continuous basis in any given location. On May&nbsp;30, 2007,
Globalstar announced that four Globalstar satellites were successfully launched, and four
additional satellites are planned for launch shortly. Globalstar stated that it believes the
additional satellites will augment the current operating constellation and improve two-way voice
and data services until the launch of the second-generation satellite constellation, which is
scheduled to begin in the summer of 2009. If the recent launch of the satellites does not remedy
the problem or if Globalstar is unable to launch a second-generation satellite constellation, this
degraded performance will have an adverse impact on sales of our products and services that rely on

officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability
to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. In addition, implementing our
product and business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, and our revenues
are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for such specialized
engineering and other talented employees in our industry is extremely competitive. In addition,
existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled
foreign national graduates of U.S. universities, making the pool of available talent even smaller.
Key employees represent a significant asset, and the competition for these employees is intense in
the wireless communications industry. In the event of a labor shortage, or in the event of an
unfavorable change in prevailing labor and/or immigration laws, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified employees.
We continue to anticipate increases in human resources, particularly in engineering, through fiscal
2008. If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified employees that we need, our business may
be harmed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in periods of poor
operating performance given the significant use of incentive compensation by our competitors. We do
not have employment agreements with our key management personnel and do not maintain key person
life insurance on any of our personnel. To the extent that new regulations make it less attractive
to grant options to employees or if stockholders do not authorize shares for the continuation of
equity compensation programs in the future, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our
equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each
of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance
activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ
from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to
practice, our reputation might also be harmed. In addition, it has become more difficult and more
expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we have purchased reduced

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On May&nbsp;18, 2005, Broadcom filed two actions in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Company
alleging infringement of ten patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based
thereon. On the same date, Broadcom also filed a complaint in the United States International Trade
Commission (ITC)&nbsp;alleging infringement of five of the same patents at issue in the Central District
Court cases seeking a determination and relief under Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. On July
1, 2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey against the Company alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and unfair
competition laws as well as common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip sales
activities, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September&nbsp;1, 2006, the
New Jersey District Court dismissed the complaint; Broadcom appealed. On September&nbsp;4, 2007, the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reinstated two of the eight federal claims and five pendant state claims in
Broadcom&#146;s complaint and affirmed the dismissal of the remaining counts. On November&nbsp;2, 2007,
Broadcom filed an amended complaint in the New Jersey case, adding the allegations from a state
court case in California that had been stayed, as discussed below. On December&nbsp;12, 2005, the Central
District Court in California ordered two of the Broadcom patent claims filed in the other Central
District patent action (which is stayed pending completion of the ITC action) to be transferred to
the Southern District of California to be considered in the case filed by the Company on August&nbsp;22,
2005. That case was subsequently dismissed by agreement of the parties. Trial was held in May&nbsp;2007
in one of the remaining Central District Court patent actions, and on May&nbsp;29, 2007, the jury
rendered a verdict finding willful infringement of three patents and awarding past damages in the
approximate amount of $20&nbsp;million, which has been expensed pending appeals. Following a change in
the law governing the definition of willfulness, the Court issued a tentative ruling that the
jury&#146;s finding of willfulness and inducement should be vacated. After a hearing on October&nbsp;15,
2007, the Court requested additional briefings by both parties, including briefing on the question
of whether the damages awarded under the two patents must be vacated and indicated that the Court
would postpone any decision on an appropriate injunction remedy pending its final decision on the
jury&#146;s finding of willfulness. The Court&#146;s final ruling on these issues and the appropriate remedy
for the jury&#146;s infringement findings is expected within the next several weeks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;14, 2006, an ITC hearing also commenced as to three patents alleged by Broadcom to
be infringed by the Company. On October&nbsp;10, 2006, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&nbsp;issued an
initial determination in which he recommended against any downstream remedies and found no
infringement by the Company on two of the three remaining patents and most of the asserted claims
of the third patent. The ALJ did find infringement on some claims of one patent. The ALJ did not
recommend excluding chips accused by Broadcom but, instead, recommended a limited exclusion order
directed only to chips that are already programmed with a specific software module and recommended
a related cease and desist order. The Commission adopted the ALJ&#146;s initial determination on
violation and, on June&nbsp;7, 2007, issued a cease and desist order and an exclusion order directed at
chips programmed with specific software and certain downstream products first imported after the
date of the exclusion order. The Federal Circuit has issued stays of the exclusion order with respect to
the downstream products of all of the Company&#146;s customers that requested the stay. The Company is
appealing both the infringement finding and the cease and desist order and the exclusion order to
the United States Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit. On April&nbsp;13, 2007, Broadcom filed a new
complaint in California state court against the Company alleging unfair competition, breach of
contract and fraud, and seeking injunctive and monetary relief. On October&nbsp;5, 2007, the Court
ordered the case stayed pending resolution of the New Jersey case, referenced above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation: </I>On October&nbsp;14, 2005, the Company filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom
alleging infringement of two patents, each of which relates to video encoding and decoding for
high-end multimedia processing, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon.
In January&nbsp;2007, a jury rendered a verdict finding the patents valid but not infringed. In a
subsequent ruling, the trial judge held that the Company was not guilty of inequitable

Court also ordered Qualcomm to pay Broadcom&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees and costs for the case. Qualcomm and
Broadcom have each filed notices of appeal. The Court is also considering a motion for discovery
sanctions against Qualcomm for failing to produce certain documents in discovery.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Actions by the Company and its subsidiaries against Nokia Corporation and/or Nokia Inc.: </I>On
November&nbsp;4, 2005, the Company, along with its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, filed an action
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Nokia alleging
infringement of eleven Qualcomm patents and one SnapTrack patent relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE and
position location and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On May&nbsp;24, 2006, the Company
filed an action in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for England and Wales against
Nokia alleging infringement of two Qualcomm patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE, seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief. On June&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed a complaint with the ITC against
Nokia alleging importation of products that infringe six Qualcomm patents relating to power
control, video encoding and decoding, and power conservation mode technologies and seeking an
exclusionary order and a cease and desist order. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, the ITC commenced an
investigation. The Company subsequently withdrew three of the patents from the proceedings. The ITC
trial was completed in September&nbsp;2007. The date for an initial determination from the ITC ALJ is
December&nbsp;12, 2007, and the target date for resolution of the investigation is April&nbsp;14, 2008. On
August&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed an action in the District Court of Dusseldorf, Federal Republic
of Germany, against Nokia alleging infringement of two Qualcomm patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE,
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed an action in
the High Court of Paris, France against Nokia alleging infringement of two patents relating to
GSM/GPRS/EDGE, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company
filed an action in the Milan Court, Italy against Nokia alleging infringement of two patents
relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In February&nbsp;2007, the
Company initiated proceedings in the People&#146;s Republic of China against Nokia for infringement of
three patents by Nokia&#146;s GSM/GPRS/EDGE products. On April&nbsp;2, 2007, the Company filed suit against
Nokia in the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division for infringement of two patents and in
the Western District of Wisconsin for infringement of three patents. These cases are directed to
Nokia GSM/GPRS/EDGE cellular phones. In response, Nokia filed counterclaims alleging infringement
by the Company of six Nokia patents, two of which Nokia also asserted against the Company&#146;s
subsidiary, MediaFLO USA, Inc. No trial date is set and discovery has not yet begun. On October&nbsp;17,
2007, the Company and MediaFLO USA, Inc. filed a motion to stay Nokia&#146;s infringement counterclaims
pending the arbitration proceeding filed on April&nbsp;5, 2007, discussed below. On July&nbsp;11, 2007, the
Wisconsin Court issued an order transferring that case to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California and the parties have consolidated the matter with the San Diego
matter referenced above and stipulated to a stay of the proceedings pending final resolution of the
ITC matter referenced above. On April&nbsp;5, 2007, the Company filed an arbitration demand with the
American Arbitration Association requesting a ruling that, among other things, Nokia&#146;s continued
use of the Company&#146;s patents in Nokia&#146;s CDMA cellular handsets (including WCDMA) after April&nbsp;9,
2007 constitutes an election by Nokia to extend its license under the parties&#146; existing agreement.
On July&nbsp;9, 2007, the Company filed an amended demand for arbitration, alleging that Nokia&#146;s
institution of certain patent infringement proceedings against the Company was a material breach of
the license agreement between the parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Nokia Corporation and Nokia Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On August&nbsp;9, 2006, Nokia
Corporation and Nokia Inc. filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court seeking declaratory and
injunctive relief relating to alleged commitments made by the Company to wireless industry
standards setting organizations. The Company has moved to dismiss the complaint. On April&nbsp;12, 2007
and June&nbsp;5, 2007, the Company filed counterclaims seeking declarations that, among other things,
the Company&#146;s 2001 license agreement with Nokia fulfilled and/or superseded any ostensible
obligations to offer or grant patent licenses to Nokia allegedly arising from the Company&#146;s
participation in certain standards setting organizations. Both parties have moved to dismiss the
other&#146;s complaints. In March&nbsp;2007, Nokia filed actions in Germany and the Netherlands alleging that
certain of the Company&#146;s patents are exhausted with regards to Nokia&#146;s products placed on the
European market that contain chipsets supplied to Nokia by Texas Instruments. On October&nbsp;23, 2007,
the German court dismissed Nokia&#146;s claims. On August&nbsp;16, 2007, Nokia Corporation and Nokia Inc.
filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)&nbsp;alleging importation
of products that infringe five Nokia patents and seeking an exclusionary order and a cease and
desist order. The ITC instituted an investigation on September&nbsp;17, 2007. The Company filed a motion
to terminate the investigation pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding instituted by the
Company on

licensing practices. The Company has received the complaints and has submitted replies to the
allegations, as well as documents and other information requested by the European Commission. On
October&nbsp;1, 2007, the European Commission announced that it was initiating a proceeding, though it
has not decided to issue a Statement of Objections, and it has not made any conclusions as to the
merits of the complaints.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tessera, Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On April&nbsp;17, 2007, Tessera, Inc. filed a patent
infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas and a
complaint with the United States ITC pursuant to Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the
Company and other companies, alleging infringement of two patents relating to semiconductor
packaging structures and seeking monetary damages and injunctive and other relief based hereon. The
ITC instituted the investigation on May&nbsp;15, 2007. On July&nbsp;11, 2007, the ITC issued an order that
set August&nbsp;21, 2008 as the target date for completion of the investigation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other: </I>The Company has been named, along with many other manufacturers of wireless phones,
wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in several purported class
action lawsuits, and individually filed actions pending in Pennsylvania and Washington D.C.,
seeking monetary damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. The courts that have reviewed
similar claims against other companies to date have held that there was insufficient scientific
basis for the plaintiffs&#146; claims in those cases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been reported that two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and Broadcom) and two South
Korean companies (Nextreaming Corp. and THINmultimedia Inc.) have filed complaints with the Korea
Fair Trade Commission alleging that the Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation
of South Korean anti-trust regulations. To date, the Company has not received the complaints but
has submitted information and documents to the Korea Fair Trade Commission.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japan Fair Trade Commission has also received unspecified complaints alleging the
Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation of Japanese law. The Company has not
received the complaints but has submitted information and documents to the Japan Fair Trade
Commission.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the claims made by other parties are without merit and will
vigorously defend the actions. Other than amounts relating to the <I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM
Incorporated </I>and <I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation </I>matters, the Company has not
recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the other legal proceedings
described above, based on the Company&#146;s belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not
probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. The Company is
engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business and believes that
the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its operating
results, liquidity or financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;11, 2007, we announced a cash dividend of $0.14 per share on our common stock,
payable on January&nbsp;4, 2008 to stockholders of record as of December&nbsp;7, 2007. We intend to continue
to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash
dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among
other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to
research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels and investments and
acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, changes in federal income tax law and changes
to our business model.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to our 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2006 Plan), we grant options to selected
employees, directors and consultants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less

of both incentive and non-qualified stock options as well as stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares and other stock-based awards.
Generally, options outstanding vest over five years and are exercisable for up to 10&nbsp;years from the
grant date. The Board of Directors may terminate the 2006 Plan at any time.

Return Index for Communications Equipment Stocks, SIC 3660-3669 (the Nasdaq Industry). The S&#038;P 500
tracks the aggregate price performance of the equity securities of 500 United States companies
selected by Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Index Committee to include companies in leading industries and to
reflect the United States stock market. The Nasdaq Industry tracks the aggregate price performance
of equity securities of communications equipment companies traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The total return for our stock and for each index assumes the reinvestment of
dividends and is based on the returns of the component companies weighted according to their
capitalizations as of the end of each annual period. We began paying dividends on our common stock
on March&nbsp;31, 2003. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and is a component

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm
CDMA Technologies, or QCT; Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL; Qualcomm Wireless &#038; Internet, or
QWI; and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives, or QSI.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software
for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system
products. QCT&#146;s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices,
particularly mobile phones, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for
wireless devices include the MSM, RF and PM devices. These integrated circuits for wireless devices
and system software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning
functions, radio conversion between RF and baseband signals and power management. QCT&#146;s system
software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and
is the foundation software enabling phone manufacturers to develop handsets utilizing the
functionality within the integrated circuits. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and
system software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless operator&#146;s base
station equipment. In addition to the key components in a wireless system, QCT provides system
reference designs and development tools to assist in customizing wireless devices and user
interfaces, to integrate our products with components developed by others, and to test
interoperability with existing and planned networks. QCT revenues comprised 59%, 58% and 58% of
total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate
foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. We rely
on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the
testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most
of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and
two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our
foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits.
Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase completed die directly from
semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract directly with third party manufacturers for
back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as
Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD,
GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives revenue from license fees as
well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using
our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing
royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed
products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT,
etc.). QTL revenues comprised 31%, 33% and 30% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues have been generated primarily through
our licensees&#146; sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES) (formerly Qualcomm Wireless Business
Solutions, or QWBS), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS)&nbsp;and Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV),
generates revenues primarily through mobile communication products and services, software and
software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QES sells equipment,
software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their
assets, products and workforce. QES also sells products that operate on the Globalstar
low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system and provides related services. Through
September&nbsp;2007, QES has shipped approximately 1,192,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based
communications systems. QIS provides BREW-based (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products
that include user interface and content delivery and management products and services for the
wireless industry. QIS also provides QChat, which enables virtually instantaneous push-to-talk
functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and
analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to United States government
agencies. QWI revenues comprised 9%, 10% and 12% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QSI manages the Company&#146;s strategic investment activities, including MediaFLO USA, Inc.
(MediaFLO USA), the Company&#146;s wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI also makes

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from customers in South Korea, China, Japan and the United States comprised 31%, 21%,
17% and 13%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2007, as compared to 32%, 17%,
21% and 13%, respectively, for fiscal 2006, and 37%, 11%, 21% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal
2005. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to
which our products, software or services are delivered and, for QTL&#146;s licensing and royalty
revenues, the domicile of our licensees. The increase in revenues from customers in China from 11%
and 17% of total revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively, to 21% in fiscal 2007 is primarily
attributable to increased shipments of integrated circuits to CDMA device manufacturers with
locations in China. The increasing trend in revenues from customers in China is expected to
continue. Combined revenues from customers in South Korea, Japan and the United States decreased as
a percentage of total revenues, from 76% in fiscal 2005 to 66% in fiscal 2006 and 61% in fiscal
2007, primarily due to increases in the percentage of revenues from WCDMA manufacturers in Western
Europe and increased activity by manufacturers with locations in China.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and
judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and
investments, share-based payments, income taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on
historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree
of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse
effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant
accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than
others.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products,
from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, from messaging and other services
and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. The
timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends
upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our
deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized
involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from
our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special
pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are
estimates, based on a number of factors, including our assumptions related to historical and
projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of our customer agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD
and/or the OFDMA standards and their derivatives. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or
more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our
licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future
benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn royalties on such licensed
CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees&#146; sales occur. Our
licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after
the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly,
payment is on a semi-annual basis. We recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by
licensees during the quarter. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to
legal disputes, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenue could be
affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. </I></B>Our business acquisitions typically result in
the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may
become impaired in the future. As of September&nbsp;30, 2007, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of
accumulated amortization, were $1.3&nbsp;billion and $664&nbsp;million, respectively. The determination of
the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets
when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and
future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our
businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this
assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows,
volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these
estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an
impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot
predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have
on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators
exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is
impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than
temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by
many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments are subject to substantial
quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. Future adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to
recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges in the future.
When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such
factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the
original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost,
the performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors
within the industry, the market in general and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also
review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing
financial difficulties. In the event our judgments change as to other-than-temporary declines in
value, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of
operations. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $16&nbsp;million, $20&nbsp;million and $13
million, respectively, in other-than-temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to
determine. These investments totaled $114&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2007. We record impairment
charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other-than-temporary. The
determination that a decline is other-than-temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in
losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring
impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private companies for an
other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the share
price from the investee&#146;s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to
its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee&#146;s revenue and cost trends, the
investee&#146;s liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate, and market acceptance of the
investee&#146;s products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party evaluations,
valuation reports or advice from investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the
investee may have forthcoming, any significant news specific to the investee or the investee&#146;s
competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates.
In the event our judgments change as to other-than temporary declines in value, we may record an
impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal
2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $11&nbsp;million, $4&nbsp;million and $1&nbsp;million, respectively, in
other-than-temporary losses on our investments in private companies. Due to financial and
competitive challenges facing our investees, we cannot assure you that our investments will
generate financial returns or that we will not have to write down our investments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Share-Based Payments. </I></B>We grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and
directors under our equity compensation plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our
common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each
six-month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans. The benefits provided under
these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of revised Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (FAS 123R), &#147;Share-Based Payment.&#148; We use the fair value method to
apply the provisions of FAS 123R with a modified prospective application. Under the modified
prospective application method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Share-based
compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $493&nbsp;million and $495
million, respectively. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense
related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.3&nbsp;billion, which is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.4&nbsp;years. Net stock options, after forfeitures
and cancellations, granted during fiscal 2007 represented 2.0% of outstanding shares as of the
beginning of the fiscal period. Total stock options granted during fiscal 2007 represented 2.3% of
outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial
option-pricing model (binomial model). The determination of the fair value of share-based payment
awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but
are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
We believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved
when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation under FAS 123R.
Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no
vesting or hedging restrictions, are fully transferable and do not cause dilution. Because our
share-based payments have characteristics significantly different

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">from those of freely traded options, and because valuation model assumptions are subjective,
in our opinion, existing valuation models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models,
may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards. There
is not currently a generally accepted market-based mechanism or other practical application to
verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models. Although
we estimate the fair value of employee share-based awards in accordance with FAS 123R and the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107 (SAB 107), the
option-pricing model we use may not produce a value that is indicative of the fair value observed
in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007, we used
the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption
input to the binomial model. We utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two
years, and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the
expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years. The weighted-average volatility
assumption was 33.4% for fiscal 2007, which if increased to 37%, would increase the
weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.80 per
share, or 5%. The volatility percentage assumed for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was based on the implied
volatility of traded options, as compared to the blend of implied and historical volatility data
used in prior years. FAS 123R includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be
considered in estimating expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more useful than
historical volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both
historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical
volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for
a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant. The
weighted-average risk-free interest rate assumption was 4.6% for fiscal 2007, which if increased to
6.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during
fiscal 2007 by $0.95 per share, or 7%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments, but we are
required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield
assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield
assumption was 1.3% for fiscal 2007, which if decreased to 0.4%, would increase the
weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.96 per
share, or 7%. Dividends and/or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to board
approval as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance, stock
repurchase programs, mergers and acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our
historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial
change, and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash
distributions that will be made to investors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation
information. The weighted-average post-vesting forfeiture rate assumption was 6.5% for fiscal 2007,
which if decreased to 1.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock
options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.73 per share, or 5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information. The
weighted-average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was 1.8 for fiscal 2007, which if increased
to 2.1, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during
fiscal 2007 by $0.66 per share, or 5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we believe
we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the
potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As part of our assessment of
potential adjustments to our tax returns, we increase our current tax liability to the extent an
adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an
adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment. We continually assess the likelihood and amount
of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and
deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although
we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable,
adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax
provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. For example, during fiscal 2007, we recorded an
income tax benefit of $331&nbsp;million resulting from the completion of audits of our fiscal 2003 and
2004 federal tax returns.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation
allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing
of the reversals of existing temporary
differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. As of September&nbsp;30, 2007, gross
deferred tax assets were $1.08&nbsp;billion. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable
income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax
rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or
deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax
assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on
operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;30, 2007, we had gross deferred tax assets of $192&nbsp;million related to realized
and unrealized capital losses and $14&nbsp;million related to foreign net operating losses. We can only
use capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our assessments of projected future capital
gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we expect that our future capital gains will
not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal 2007.
Therefore, we have provided a $6&nbsp;million valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we
do not expect to utilize. We can only use foreign net operating losses to offset taxable income of
certain legal entities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. Based upon our assessments of
projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we
expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be
sufficient to utilize the foreign net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2007.
Therefore, we have provided a full valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant
judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains, the timing of
realization of capital losses and the amount of future taxable income in certain foreign
jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital
losses, capital gains and foreign taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be invested
indefinitely outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will
be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for United States
federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $4.7&nbsp;billion as
of September&nbsp;30, 2007. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income
tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is
made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the adoption of FAS 123R in fiscal 2006, we recognize windfall tax benefits associated
with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders&#146; equity only when realized.
Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting
from windfall tax benefits occurring from September&nbsp;26, 2005 onward. A windfall tax benefit occurs
when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee&#146;s disposition of a share-based award
exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that we had recorded. When
assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has been realized, we follow
the tax law ordering method, under which current year share-based compensation deductions are
assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Litigation. </I></B>We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no
assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse
effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without
merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to
pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate
of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range
of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability
related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential
liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Other than amounts relating
to the <I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated </I>and <I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom
Corporation </I>matters, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with
any other legal proceedings based on our belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are
not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. Revisions in
our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations.

billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees increased primarily as a result
of a $306&nbsp;million increase in royalties reported to QTL by our external licensees resulting from an
increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and a $30&nbsp;million increase in QIS revenues
primarily related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and a licensing agreement with
Sprint. Worldwide demand for CDMA-based products has increased primarily as a result of the growth
in sales of high-end WCDMA products and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA2000
products.

as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 47% for fiscal 2007, compared to 46% for
fiscal 2006. Cost of equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2007 included $39&nbsp;million in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2007, research and development expenses were
$1.83&nbsp;billion or 21% of revenues, compared to $1.54&nbsp;billion or 20% of revenues for fiscal 2006. The
dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $283&nbsp;million increase in costs related to
integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our
intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced
wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with
consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products
and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting
these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA
(including GSM/GPRS/EDGE), HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA. The increase in research and development
expenses incurred also related to the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and IMOD
display products using MEMS technology. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2007 included
share-based compensation and in-process research and development of $221&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million,
respectively, compared to $216&nbsp;million and $22&nbsp;million, respectively, in fiscal 2006.

administrative expenses were $1.48&nbsp;billion or 17% of revenues, compared to $1.12&nbsp;billion or 15% of
revenues for fiscal 2006. The dollar and percentage increases were primarily attributable to a $152
million increase in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, a $98&nbsp;million increase in
employee related expenses, a $40&nbsp;million increase in other professional fees, a $39&nbsp;million
increase in bad debt expense, a $32&nbsp;million increase in cooperative and other marketing expenses
and a $28&nbsp;million increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $44&nbsp;million gain
on the sale of a building. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 included
share-based compensation of $233&nbsp;million, compared to $238&nbsp;million in fiscal 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by
corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances
and higher interest rates on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on corporate
investments increased primarily due to strength in the equity markets and reallocation of certain
portfolio assets. Losses on derivative instruments in fiscal 2006 related primarily to changes in
the fair values of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program. Equity in
losses of investees in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the effect of investment losses
recognized by Inquam and a venture fund investee in fiscal 2006, of which our share was $20&nbsp;million
and $11&nbsp;million, respectively.

million for fiscal 2006. The annual effective tax rate was 9% for fiscal 2007, compared to 22% for
fiscal 2006. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is lower than the annual effective tax
rate for fiscal 2006 primarily due to the impact of prior year audits completed during fiscal 2007
and additional foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal statutory tax rate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is 26% lower than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 20% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, 9% related to the impact of the tax audits completed
during the year and 2% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state
taxes of approximately 5%.

$3.74&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $1.00&nbsp;billion,
resulting primarily from an increase of $1.34&nbsp;billion related primarily to higher unit shipments of
MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $349&nbsp;million related
to the net effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix.

billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees increased primarily as a result
of a $774&nbsp;million increase in royalty revenue, consisting primarily of royalties reported to QTL by
our external licensees, resulting from an increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and
the impact of the expiration of one of our royalty sharing obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2006 was

as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 46% for fiscal 2006, compared to 44% for
fiscal 2005. The decline in margin percentage in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily
due to the effect of $41&nbsp;million in share-based compensation during fiscal 2006 as a result of the
adoption of FAS123R during fiscal 2006 and a decrease in QCT margin percentage resulting primarily
from an increase in product support costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by
corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances
and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on QSI
investments in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from a $48&nbsp;million gain on our minority investment in
a wireless publisher and a $41&nbsp;million gain on the sale of our investment in a wireless
telecommunications company. Losses and gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2006 and 2005,
respectively, related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection
with our stock repurchase program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Tax Expense. </I></B>Income tax expense was $686&nbsp;million for fiscal 2006, compared to $666
million for fiscal 2005. The annual effective tax rate was approximately 22% for fiscal 2006,
compared to 24% for fiscal 2005. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was lower than the
annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal tax rate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 13% lower than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 15% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, 2% related to the impact of prior year tax audits
completed during the year, 1% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from our increased
ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 1% related to research and development tax
credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 5% and other permanent differences of 1%.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QCT Segment. </I></B>QCT revenues for fiscal 2007 were $5.28&nbsp;billion, compared to $4.33&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2006. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM
integrated circuits, were $5.12&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $4.20&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2006.
The increase in equipment and services revenue resulted primarily from an increase of $761&nbsp;million
related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $144&nbsp;million related to the net effects of
changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 253&nbsp;million MSM
integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 207&nbsp;million for fiscal
2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $1.55&nbsp;billion, compared to $1.30&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2006. QCT&#146;s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage)
was 29% in fiscal 2007, compared to 30% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating margin percentage
was primarily due to increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative
expenses, partially offset by an increase in the gross margin percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT inventories increased by 116% in fiscal 2007 from $179&nbsp;million to $387&nbsp;million due to
increased purchases of completed die directly from foundry suppliers for use in QCT&#146;s CDMA-based
integrated circuit products in connection with the shift in our manufacturing business model from
turnkey to IFM.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QTL Segment. </I></B>QTL revenues for fiscal 2007 were $2.77&nbsp;billion, compared to $2.47&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2006. QTL&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $2.34&nbsp;billion, compared to $2.23
billion for fiscal 2006. QTL&#146;s operating margin percentage was 84% in fiscal 2007, compared to 90%
in fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues primarily resulted from a $306&nbsp;million increase in
royalties reported to us by our external licensees, which were $2.72&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2007,
compared to $2.42&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2006. Revenues from amortized license fees were $49&nbsp;million in
fiscal 2007, compared to $50&nbsp;million in fiscal 2006. The increase in earnings before taxes
was primarily attributable to the increase in
revenues, partially offset by increases in legal and bad debt expenses, which resulted in a
corresponding decline in operating margin percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QWI Segment. </I></B>QWI revenues for fiscal 2007 were $828&nbsp;million, compared to $731&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2006. Revenues increased primarily due to increases of $78&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million in QIS
and QES revenues, respectively. The increase in QIS revenues is primarily attributable to a $61
million increase in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under a licensing
agreement with Sprint and an $18&nbsp;million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer
base and products. The increase in QES revenues is primarily attributable to a $26&nbsp;million increase
in equipment and messaging revenues, partially offset by a $15&nbsp;million decrease in amortization of
deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales. QES shipped approximately 190,300
terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 140,300
terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems in fiscal 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $88&nbsp;million, compared to $78&nbsp;million for
fiscal 2006. QWI&#146;s operating margin percentage was 11% in fiscal 2007, compared to 10% in fiscal
2006. The increase in QWI&#146;s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $54&nbsp;million increase in
QIS gross margin, largely resulting from our expanded BREW customer base and products and QChat
development efforts, partially offset by a $29&nbsp;million increase in QWI selling, general and
administrative expenses and an $18&nbsp;million decrease in QES gross margin. The increase in QWI&#146;s
operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increase in QIS gross margin,
partially offset by the decrease in QES gross margin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>QSI Segment</I></B>. QSI&#146;s loss before taxes for fiscal 2007 was $240&nbsp;million, compared to $133
million for fiscal 2006. QSI&#146;s loss before taxes included a $118&nbsp;million increase in our MediaFLO
USA subsidiary&#146;s loss before taxes comprised primarily of $70&nbsp;million in cost of services revenues
related to the commencement of our MediaFLO services in March&nbsp;2007 and a $42&nbsp;million increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses, including $20
million related to cooperative marketing expenses. During fiscal 2006, QSI recorded $30
million in equity in losses of investees resulting primarily from the effect of investment losses
recognized by Inquam and a venture fund investee in fiscal 2006, of which our share was $20&nbsp;million
and $11&nbsp;million, respectively. Equity in losses of investees was nominal during fiscal 2007.

was 30% during both fiscal 2006 and 2005. The operating margin percentage remained consistent as
the gross margin percentage decrease, resulting primarily from an increase in product support

billion for fiscal 2005. QTL&#146;s operating margin percentage was 90% in fiscal 2006 as compared to
89% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily resulted from
a $774&nbsp;million increase in royalties reported to us by our licensees, which were $2.42&nbsp;billion in
fiscal 2006, compared to $1.64&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in royalty revenue relates to
the increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and the impact of the expiration of one
of our royalty sharing obligations. Revenues from amortized license fees were $50&nbsp;million in fiscal
2006, compared to $69&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005.

were $11.8&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2007, an
increase of $1.9&nbsp;billion from September&nbsp;24, 2006. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities at September&nbsp;30, 2007 consisted of $5.5&nbsp;billion held by foreign subsidiaries with the
remaining balance of $6.3&nbsp;billion held domestically. Due to tax considerations, we derive liquidity
for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically. Cash provided
by operating activities was $3.8&nbsp;billion during fiscal 2007, compared to $3.3&nbsp;billion during fiscal
2006. Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;22, 2007, we announced we had been authorized to repurchase up to $3.0&nbsp;billion of our
common stock. The $3.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program replaced a $2.5&nbsp;billion stock repurchase
program, of which approximately $0.9&nbsp;billion remained authorized for repurchases. The stock
repurchase program has no expiration date. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased and retired
37,263,000 shares of our common stock for $1.5&nbsp;billion. In connection with the stock repurchase
program, we have put options outstanding, with expiration dates ranging from December&nbsp;2007 through
March&nbsp;2008, that may require us to repurchase an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock
upon exercise for $189&nbsp;million (net of the option premiums received). Any shares repurchased upon
exercise of put options will be retired. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, $1.5&nbsp;billion remains authorized for
repurchases under our stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding. In the period from
October&nbsp;1, 2007 through November&nbsp;7, 2007 we repurchased and retired 12,720,000 shares of our own
common stock for approximately $525&nbsp;million. We will continue our active evaluation of repurchases
under this program.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We declared and paid dividends totaling $862&nbsp;million, $698&nbsp;million and $524&nbsp;million, or $0.52,
$0.42 and $0.32 per common share, during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. On October&nbsp;11,
2007, we announced a cash dividend of $0.14 per share on our common stock, payable on January&nbsp;4,
2008 to stockholders of record as of December&nbsp;7, 2007. We intend to continue to pay quarterly
dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in
the best interest of our stockholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts
receivable increased by 2% during fiscal 2007. Days sales outstanding, on a
consolidated basis, were 27&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;30, 2007 compared to 29&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;24, 2006.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2007 as
compared to fiscal 2006 and the contractual timing of cash receipts for royalty receivables, some
of which are paid semi-annually. The change in days sales outstanding was a result of the increase

in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48 (FIN 48) &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes&#148; which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in
the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim
periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The accounting provisions of FIN
48 are effective for us beginning October&nbsp;1, 2007. The cumulative effect of initially adopting FIN
48 will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will
be presented separately. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition
threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. We are in the process of
finalizing the impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements but
expect the adjustment to opening retained earnings to be immaterial.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest Rate Risk. </I></B>We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and
non-investment grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable
debt securities and debt mutual funds. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates
can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates
in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing
securities could lose value. If the general economy were to weaken significantly, the credit
profile, financial strength and growth prospects of issuers of interest-bearing securities held in
our investment portfolios could deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities could lose value.
We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return
trade-offs that do not perform well.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table provides information about our interest-bearing securities that are
sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted average
yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that these securities
are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation
purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Mortgage Risk. </I></B>A small portion of our diversified investment program includes investment-grade
mortgage- and asset-backed securities. In fiscal 2007, following a multi-year housing industry
expansion, mortgage industry excesses became apparent and caused concern among investors in pools
of residential mortgages or other assets securitized by them. We have no direct investments in the
lowest credit quality, or subprime, mortgages nor investments collateralized by assets that include
subprime mortgages. We have indirect exposure to subprime mortgages to the extent of our
investments in large, diversified financial companies, commercial banks, insurance companies and
public/private investment funds that participate or invest in subprime mortgage loans, mortgage
insurance, or loan servicing, which could impact the fair values of our securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Equity Price Risk. </I></B>We have a diversified marketable securities portfolio, including mutual
fund and exchange traded fund shares, that is subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of
marketable equity securities increased to $1.52&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2007 from $1.34&nbsp;billion at
September&nbsp;24, 2006. The recorded values of equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares
increased to $1.87&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2007 from $1.52&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;24, 2006. We make
equity investments in companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in
investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the
market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund
shares at September&nbsp;30, 2007 would cause a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of
these securities of $339&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private
early-stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that
our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not
anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management&#146;s
objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded values of these
strategic investments totaled $114&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2007, compared to $93&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;24, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sell put options that may require us to
repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices. These written put options subject us to
equity price risk. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, we had two outstanding put options, enabling holders to
sell 5,000,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise
for approximately $189&nbsp;million (net of the option premiums received). The put option
liabilities, with a fair value of $10&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2007, were included in other current
liabilities. If the fair value of our common stock at September&nbsp;30, 2007 decreased by 15%, the
amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares by
$9&nbsp;million, net of the $14&nbsp;million in premiums received.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Foreign Exchange Risk. </I></B>We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign
currency forward and option contracts. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging
or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September&nbsp;30,
2007, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, we had a net
liability of $1&nbsp;million related to our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign
currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and
WCDMA products. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 30% and foreign exchange
rates were to change unfavorably by 30% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a
loss of approximately $6&nbsp;million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our
hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1
&#151; The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies&#148; for a description of our foreign currency
accounting policies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the
functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may
affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and
liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency
transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign
currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments.
While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency
values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our
products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.

financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of
human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of QUALCOMM Incorporated:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated
and its subsidiaries at September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24, 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September&nbsp;30, 2007
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"> </SUP>appearing
under Item&nbsp;15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September&nbsp;30, 2007, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated
Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement
schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule, and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in fiscal 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>The Company. </I></B>QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM), a Delaware corporation,
develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and
services. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA)-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications,
multimedia functions and global positioning system products to wireless device and infrastructure
manufacturers. The Company also manufactures and sells products based upon Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA)&nbsp;technology, e.g. FLASH-OFDM. The Company grants licenses to
use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential
to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, and receives license
fees as well as ongoing royalties based on sales by licensees of wireless telecommunications
equipment products incorporating its patented technologies. Currently, the vast majority of the
Company&#146;s license fees and royalty revenue is comprised of fees and royalties from companies
selling wireless products incorporating the Company&#146;s CDMA technologies, but the Company has also
licensed its patented OFDMA technology. The Company provides satellite- and terrestrial-based
two-way data messaging and position reporting services for transportation companies, private
fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. The Company provides the BREW
(Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) product and services to wireless network operators,
handset manufacturers and application developers and support for developing and delivering
over-the-air wireless applications and services. The Company also makes strategic investments to
promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and internet data
communications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Principles of Consolidation. </I></B>The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the
assets, liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries. The ownership of the
other interest holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest and is not
significant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees are included in the consolidated
financial statements one month in arrears to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in
the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not have any investments in
entities it believes are variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary
beneficiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Financial Statement Preparation. </I></B>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Fiscal Year. </I></B>The Company operates and reports using a 52-53&nbsp;week fiscal year ending on the
last Sunday in September. Fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2007 included 53&nbsp;weeks. The fiscal year
ended September&nbsp;24, 2006 and September&nbsp;25, 2005 each included 52&nbsp;weeks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit
products, from royalties for its intellectual property, from messaging and other services and
related hardware sales, from software development and licensing and related services, and from
license fees for intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue
actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of
each arrangement and the nature of the Company&#146;s deliverables and obligations. The development
stage of the Company&#146;s customers&#146; products does not affect the timing or amount of revenue
recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company licenses rights to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain
wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Wideband
CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA Time Division Duplex (TDD)&nbsp;and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives.
Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on
their sales of products incorporating or using the Company&#146;s licensed intellectual property.
License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee,
typically five to seven years. The Company earns royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold
worldwide by its licensees at the time that the licensees&#146; sales occur. The Company&#146;s licensees, however, do
not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that
quarter, and, in some instances,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a
semi-annual basis. The Company recognizes royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees
during the quarter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of the Company&#146;s CDMA-based integrated circuits are recognized at the time
of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue
recognition are met, if later. Revenues from providing services are recorded when earned.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes revenues allocated to certain satellite and terrestrial-based two-way
data messaging and position reporting hardware using the residual method. Revenues from such sales
are recorded at the time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other
criteria for revenue recognition are met.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from long-term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The
percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs. Revenue
and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit
estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the
revision become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of contract
profit would be required. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued
profit are classified as unearned revenue in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets. Estimated
contract losses are recognized when determined. If substantive uncertainty related to customer
acceptance exists or the contract&#146;s duration is relatively short, the Company uses the
completed-contract method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides both perpetual and renewable time-based software licenses. Revenues from
software license fees are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: the written
agreement is executed; the software is delivered; the license fee is fixed and determinable;
collectibility of the license fee is probable; and if applicable, when vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of multiple-element arrangements,
including post-contract customer support. When contracts contain multiple elements wherein
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements, the Company
recognizes revenue for the delivered elements and defers revenue for the fair value of the
undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied. If vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, revenue for the
delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining obligations have been satisfied, or
if the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support and vendor specific objective
evidence of the fair value of post-contract customer support does not exist, revenue from the
entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. Judgments and estimates are made
in connection with the recognition of software license revenue, which may include assessments of
collectibility, the fair value of deliverable elements and the implied support period. The amount
or timing of the Company&#146;s software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in these
judgments or estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special
pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are based
on a number of factors, including the contractual provisions of the customer agreements and the
Company&#146;s assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes, market share and
inventory levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products, license fees for
intellectual property, hardware products sales with continuing performance obligations and billings
on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Concentrations. </I></B>A significant portion of the Company&#146;s revenues is concentrated with a limited
number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless telecommunications products is dominated
by a small number of large corporations. Revenues from three customers of the Company&#146;s QCT, QTL
and QWI segments each comprised an aggregate of 14%, 14% and 13% of total consolidated revenues in
fiscal 2007, compared to 13% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 15%, 13% and 11% of
total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005. Aggregated accounts receivable from these three
customers comprised 50% and 45% of gross accounts receivable at September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September
24, 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from international customers were approximately 87% of total consolidated revenues in
fiscal 2007 and 2006 and 82% of total consolidated revenues in 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services Revenues. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues is primarily

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">services revenues. Cost of equipment revenues consists of the cost of
equipment sold and sustaining engineering costs, including personnel and related costs. Cost of
messaging services revenues consists principally of satellite transponder costs, network operations
expenses, including personnel and related costs, depreciation and airtime charges by
telecommunications operators. Cost of development and other services revenues primarily includes
personnel costs and related expenses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Shipping and Handling Costs. </I></B>Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of
equipment and services revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a
customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development. </I></B>Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed
as incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after technological feasibility
of the software is established.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Marketing. </I></B>Certain cooperative marketing programs reimburse customers for marketing activities
for certain of the Company&#146;s products and services, subject to defined criteria. Cooperative
marketing obligations are accrued and the costs are recorded in the period in which the costs are
incurred by the customer and the Company is obligated to reimburse the customer. Cooperative
marketing costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent that a
marketing benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the cash paid does
not exceed the fair value of that marketing benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the fair
value of the marketing benefit received is recorded as a reduction in revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in
income in the period such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While the Company believes
it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns, the Company regularly
assesses the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of
its provision for income taxes. As part of its assessment of potential adjustments to its tax
returns, the Company increases its current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result
in a cash tax payment or decreases its deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not
result in a cash tax payment. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of
potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred
taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options
directly to stockholders&#146; equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not
recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits. A windfall
tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the Company upon an employee&#146;s
disposition of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the
award that the Company had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based
compensation has been realized, the Company follows the tax law ordering method, under which
current year share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating
loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cash Equivalents. </I></B>The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and government agencies&#146; securities. The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Marketable Securities. </I></B>The appropriate classification of marketable securities is determined
at the time of purchase, and such designation is reevaluated as of each balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value as determined by the most recently traded
price of each security at the balance sheet date. For securities that may not have been actively
traded in a given period, fair value is determined using matrix pricing and other valuation
techniques. The net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a
component of comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The specific identification method is used to
compute the realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>QUALCOMM Incorporated<BR>
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its marketable
securities. When assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the
Company considers factors including: how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the
original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost,
the performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors
within the industry, expected market volatility and the market in general, analyst recommendations,
the views of external investment managers, any news or financial information that has been released
specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.
If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and
is other-than-temporary, the Company records a charge to investment income (expense).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Allowances for Doubtful Accounts. </I></B>The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company&#146;s customers to make required payments.
The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably
assured: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic
industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience
with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from various credit organizations to
ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors. The Company may also request
financial information, including financial statements or other documents (e.g. bank statements) to
ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate
collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured,
which is generally upon receipt of cash. If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers were
to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Inventories. </I></B>Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost, not to
exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventory is
assessed based on review of committed purchase orders from customers, as well as purchase
commitment projections provided by customers, among other things.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Property, Plant and Equipment. </I></B>Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over 30&nbsp;years and 15&nbsp;years, respectively.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging
from 2 to 15&nbsp;years. Direct external and internal costs of developing software for internal use are
capitalized subsequent to the preliminary stage of development. Leased property meeting certain
capital lease criteria is capitalized, and the net present value of the related lease payments is
recorded as a liability. Amortization of capital leased assets is recorded using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Maintenance, repairs, and
minor renewals and betterments are charged to expense as incurred.

developed or are developing innovative wireless data applications and wireless operators that
promote the worldwide deployment of CDMA systems. Investments in corporate entities with less than
a 20% voting interest are generally accounted for under the cost method. The cost method is also
used to account for investments that are not in-substance common stock. The Company uses the equity
method to account for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock of corporate
entities, including limited liability corporations that do not maintain specific ownership
accounts, in which it has a voting interest of 20% to 50% or in which it otherwise has the ability
to exercise significant influence, and in partnerships and limited liability corporations that do
maintain specific ownership accounts in which it has other than minor to 50% ownership interests.
Under the equity method, the investment is originally recorded at cost and adjusted to recognize
the Company&#146;s share of net earnings or losses of the investee, limited to the extent of the
Company&#146;s investment in and advances to the investee and financial guarantees on behalf of the
investee that create additional basis. The Company&#146;s equity in net earnings or losses of its
investees is recorded one month in arrears to facilitate the timely inclusion of such equity in net
earnings or losses in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.

and is recognized as expense over the employee&#146;s requisite service period. The Company adopted the
provisions of FAS 123R using a modified prospective application. Accordingly, fiscal 2005 results
were not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of FAS 123R apply to new awards
and to awards that were outstanding on the effective date, which are subsequently modified or
cancelled. Estimated compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date is
recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma

123).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for
the terms of the Company&#146;s employee stock options. The Company does not target a specific dividend
yield for its dividend payments but is required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the
binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company&#146;s history and expectation of
future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future. The post-vesting
forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factor are based on the Company&#146;s historical option
cancellation and employee exercise information, respectively. The suboptimal exercise factor is the
ratio by which the stock price must increase over the exercise price before employees are expected
to exercise their stock options.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock
options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the binomial model. The
expected life of employee stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions used in
the Company&#146;s model. The binomial model assumes that employees&#146; exercise behavior is a function of
the options&#146; remaining contractual life and the extent to which the option is in-the-money (i.e.
the average stock price during the period is above the strike price of the stock option). The
binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on
the history of exercises and cancellations of past grants made by the Company. The expected life of
employee stock options granted, derived from the binomial model, was 6.2&nbsp;years and 5.8&nbsp;years during
fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-vesting forfeiture rate represents the rate at which stock options are expected to be
forfeited by employees prior to their vesting. Pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated to be
approximately 0% in both fiscal 2007 and 2006, based on historical experience. The effect of
pre-vesting forfeitures on the Company&#146;s recorded expense has historically been negligible due to
the predominantly monthly vesting of option grants. If pre-vesting forfeitures occur in the future,
the Company will record the effect of such forfeitures as the forfeitures occur. The Company will
continue to evaluate the appropriateness of this assumption. In the Company&#146;s pro forma information
required under FAS 123 for the periods prior to fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures
as they occurred.

fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to share-based awards granted during those periods. The
remaining share-based compensation expense primarily related to stock option awards granted in
earlier periods. In addition, for fiscal 2007 and 2006, $240&nbsp;million and $403&nbsp;million,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">disclosures of FAS 123. Because the Company established the
exercise price based on the fair market value of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of grant, the
stock options had no intrinsic value upon grant, and therefore no estimated expense was recorded
prior to adopting FAS 123R. Each accounting period, the Company reported the potential dilutive
impact of stock options in its diluted earnings per common share using the treasury-stock method.
Out-of-the-money stock options (i.e. the average stock price during the period was below the strike
price of the stock option) were not included in diluted earnings per common share as their effect
was anti-dilutive.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during fiscal 2005
was $14.80 per share. The fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes model and assuming a
weighted average expected life of 6&nbsp;years and weighted average annualized percentages of 3.9% for
the risk-free interest rate, 36.5% for volatility and 0.8% for the dividend yield. For purposes of
pro forma disclosures under FAS 123, the estimated fair values of share-based payments are assumed
to be amortized to expense over the vesting periods. The pro forma effects of recognizing estimated
compensation expense under the fair value method on net income and earnings per common share for
the year ended September&nbsp;25, 2005 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately. Only tax
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be
recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The Company is in the process of finalizing the impact the
adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated financial statements but expects the adjustment to
opening retained earnings to be immaterial.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investments in marketable securities were caused
primarily by a combination of short-term industry-and market-specific events. The duration and
severity of the unrealized losses in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments
were largely consistent with the expected volatility of each asset category. The Company&#146;s analysis
of market research, industry reports, economic forecasts and the specific circumstances of the
issuer indicate that it is reasonable to expect a recovery in fair value up to the
Company&#146;s cost basis within a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, the Company considered
these unrealized losses to be temporary at September&nbsp;30, 2007.

amount of $174&nbsp;million and goodwill are subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to
these purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $68&nbsp;million, $32&nbsp;million and
$19&nbsp;million, respectively, and is expected to be $67&nbsp;million in fiscal 2008, $58&nbsp;million in fiscal
2009, $52&nbsp;million in fiscal 2010, $49&nbsp;million in fiscal 2011, $41&nbsp;million in fiscal 2012, and $223
million thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized software development costs, which are included in other assets, were $14&nbsp;million
and $27&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24, 2006, respectively. Accumulated
amortization on capitalized software was $14&nbsp;million and $27&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2007 and
September&nbsp;24, 2006, respectively. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was
negligible in fiscal 2007 and was $1&nbsp;million and $4&nbsp;million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strategic equity investments as of September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24, 2006 totaled $114
million and $94&nbsp;million, respectively, including $86&nbsp;million and $73&nbsp;million, respectively,
accounted for using the cost method. Differences between the carrying amounts of strategic equity
investments accounted for using the equity method and the Company&#146;s underlying equity in the net
assets of those investees were not significant at September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24, 2006. At
September&nbsp;30, 2007, effective ownership interests in equity method investees ranged from
approximately 19% to 50%. Funding commitments related to these investments totaled $7&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;30, 2007, which the Company expects to fund through fiscal 2009. Such commitments are
subject to the investees meeting certain conditions. As such, actual equity funding may be in
lesser amounts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has not provided for United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a
cumulative total of approximately $4.7&nbsp;billion of undistributed earnings from certain non-United
States subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should the Company repatriate
foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period
management determined that the Company would repatriate the earnings. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a temporary incentive for
corporations in the United States to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85
percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $0.5&nbsp;billion of foreign
earnings qualifying for the special incentive and recorded a related expense of approximately $35
million for federal and state income tax liabilities. This distribution does not change the
Company&#146;s intention to reinvest indefinitely the undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign
subsidiaries in operations outside the United States.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;30, 2007, the Company had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of $206
million expiring from 2019 through 2026, unused state net operating loss carryforwards of $98
million expiring from 2008 through 2016, and unused foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $75
million, with $57&nbsp;million expiring from 2008 through 2016. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, the Company had
unused federal income tax credits of $195&nbsp;million, with $185&nbsp;million expiring from 2022 through
2027, and state income tax credits of $9&nbsp;million, which do not expire. The Company does not expect
its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and its federal income tax credits to expire
unused.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes, more likely than not, that it will have sufficient taxable income after
stock option related deductions to utilize the majority of its deferred tax assets. As of September
30, 2007, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses and net
capital losses of $14&nbsp;million and $6&nbsp;million, respectively. The valuation allowances reflect the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Preferred Stock. </I></B>The Company has 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance
in one or more series, at a par value of $0.0001 per share. In conjunction with the distribution of
preferred share purchase rights, 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock are designated as Series&nbsp;A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock and such shares are reserved for issuance upon exercise of the
preferred share purchase rights. At September&nbsp;30, 2007 and September&nbsp;24, 2006, no shares of
preferred stock were outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Preferred Share Purchase Rights Agreement. </I></B>The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Agreement (Rights Agreement) to protect stockholders&#146; interests in the event of a proposed takeover
of the Company. Under the original Rights Agreement, adopted on September&nbsp;26, 1995, the Company
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company&#146;s
common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, as amended and restated on December&nbsp;7,
2006, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a one one-thousandth
share of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, subject to
adjustment for subsequent stock splits, at a purchase price of $180. The Rights are exercisable
only if a person or group (an Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the
Company&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock without Board approval. Upon exercise, holders, other
than an Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to termination, to receive the Company&#146;s
common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having a market value, as defined, equal to
twice such purchase price. The Rights, which expire on September&nbsp;25, 2015, are redeemable in whole,
but not in part, at the Company&#146;s option prior to the time such Rights are triggered for a price of
$0.001 per Right.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Stock Repurchase Program. </I></B>On May&nbsp;22, 2007, the Company announced that it had been authorized
to repurchase up to $3.0&nbsp;billion of the Company&#146;s common stock. The $3.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase
program replaced a $2.5&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program, of which approximately $0.9&nbsp;billion
remained authorized for repurchases. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. When
stock is repurchased and retired, the amount paid in excess of par value is recorded to paid-in
capital. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company repurchased and retired 37,263,000,
34,000,000 and 27,083,000 shares of common stock for $1.5&nbsp;billion, $1.5&nbsp;billion and $953&nbsp;million,
respectively, excluding $9&nbsp;million and $5&nbsp;million of premiums received related to put options that
were exercised in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, approximately $1.5
billion remained authorized for repurchases under the stock repurchase program, net of put options
outstanding. In the period from October&nbsp;1, 2007 through November&nbsp;7, 2007, we repurchased and
retired 12,720,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock for approximately $525&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Company&#146;s stock repurchase program, the Company sold put options on its
own stock during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, the Company had two outstanding
put options enabling holders to sell 5,000,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock to the Company
for approximately $189&nbsp;million (net of the put option premiums received), and the recorded values
of the put option liabilities totaled $10&nbsp;million. Any shares purchased upon the exercise of the
put options will be retired. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $3&nbsp;million and $29
million, respectively, in investment losses due to net increases in the fair values of put options,
net of premiums received of $17&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million, respectively. During fiscal 2005, the
Company recognized gains of $31&nbsp;million in investment income due to decreases in the fair values
of put options, including premiums received of $15&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Dividends. </I></B>The Company announced increases in its quarterly dividend per share of common stock
from $0.07 to $0.09 on March&nbsp;8, 2005, from $0.09 to $0.12 on March&nbsp;7, 2006 and from $0.12 to $0.14

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;11, 2007, the Company announced a cash dividend of $0.14 per share on the Company&#146;s
common stock, payable on January&nbsp;4, 2008 to stockholders of record as of December&nbsp;7, 2007, which
will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 8. Employee Benefit Plans</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Employee Savings and Retirement Plan. </I></B>The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows eligible
employees to contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, subject to annual limits. The
Company matches a portion of the employee contributions and may, at its discretion, make additional
contributions based upon earnings. The Company&#146;s contribution expense for fiscal 2007, 2006 and
2005 was $39&nbsp;million, $33&nbsp;million and $27&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Equity Compensation Plans. </I></B>The Board of Directors may grant options to selected employees,
directors and consultants to the Company to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at a
price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The 2006 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan) was adopted during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and replaced
the 2001 Stock Option Plan and the 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan and their
predecessor plans (the Prior Plans). The 2006 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and
nonstatutory stock options as well as stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, performance units and shares and other stock-based awards and will be the source of shares
issued under the Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (ERMCP). The share reserve under
the 2006 Plan is equal to the shares available for future grant under the combined plans on the
date the 2006 Plan was approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders, plus an additional 65,000,000 shares
for a total of approximately 280,192,000 shares reserved. This share amount is automatically
increased by the amount equal to the number of shares subject to any outstanding option under a
Prior Plan that is terminated or cancelled (but not an option under a Prior Plan that expires)
following the date that the 2006 Plan was approved by stockholders. Shares that are subject to an
award under the ERMCP and are returned to the Company because they fail to vest will again become
available for grant under the 2006 Plan. The Board of Directors of the Company may amend or
terminate the 2006 Plan at any time. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding
five years and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2006, the Company assumed a total of approximately 3,530,000 outstanding stock
options under the Flarion Technologies, Inc. 2000 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Purchase Plan,
the Berkana Wireless Inc. 2002 Stock Plan and 2002 Executive Stock Plan and under the Qualphone
Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the Assumed Plans), as amended, as a result of the acquisitions
(Note 11). The Assumed Plans were suspended on the dates of acquisition, and no additional shares
may be granted under those plans. The Assumed Plans provided for the grant of both incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not
exceeding four years and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date.

years. Total share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory and fixed assets was $1
million during both fiscal 2007 and 2006. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised
during fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $708&nbsp;million and $1.1&nbsp;billion, respectively. The Company recorded
cash received from the exercise of stock options of $479&nbsp;million and $608&nbsp;million and related tax
benefits of $272&nbsp;million and $421&nbsp;million during fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Upon option
exercise, the Company issues new shares of stock.

eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value
on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period. Employees may authorize the Company
to withhold up to 15% of their compensation during any offering period, subject to certain
limitations. The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to approximately 24,309,000 shares
to be granted. The 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to 400,000 shares
to be granted. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 2,650,000, 2,220,000 and 1,786,000
shares were issued under the plans at an average price of $32.08, $31.10 and $29.63 per share,
respectively. At September&nbsp;30, 2007, approximately 10,576,000 shares were reserved for future
issuance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Executive Retirement Plans. </I></B>The Company has voluntary retirement plans that allow eligible
executives to defer up to 100% of their income on a pre-tax basis. On a quarterly basis, the
Company matches up to 10% of the participants&#146; deferral in Company common stock based on the
then-current market price, to be distributed to the participant upon eligible retirement. The
income deferred and the Company match held in trust are unsecured and subject to the claims of
general creditors of the Company. Company contributions begin vesting based on certain minimum
participation or service requirements and are fully vested at age 65. Participants who terminate
employment forfeit their unvested shares. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 126,000,
47,000 and 92,000 shares, respectively, were allocated under the plans. The Company recorded $5

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Litigation. </I></B><I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On May&nbsp;18, 2005, Broadcom filed
two actions in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the
Company alleging infringement of ten patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief
based thereon. On the same date, Broadcom also filed a complaint in the United States International
Trade Commission (ITC)&nbsp;alleging infringement of five of the same patents at issue in the Central
District Court cases seeking a determination and relief under Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of
1930. On July&nbsp;1, 2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey against the Company alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and
unfair competition laws as well as common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip
sales activities, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September&nbsp;1,
2006, the New Jersey District Court dismissed the complaint; Broadcom appealed. On September&nbsp;4,
2007, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reinstated two of
the eight federal claims and five pendant state
claims in Broadcom&#146;s complaint and affirmed the dismissal of the remaining counts. On November&nbsp;2,
2007, Broadcom filed an amended complaint in the New Jersey case, adding the allegations from a
state court case in California that had been stayed, as discussed below. On December&nbsp;12, 2005, the
Central District Court in California ordered two of the Broadcom patent claims filed in the other
Central District patent action (which is stayed pending completion of the ITC action) to be
transferred to the Southern District of California to be considered in the case filed by the
Company on August&nbsp;22, 2005. That case was subsequently dismissed by agreement of the parties. Trial
was held in May&nbsp;2007 in one of the remaining Central District Court patent actions, and on May&nbsp;29,
2007, the jury rendered a verdict finding willful infringement of three patents and awarding past
damages in the approximate amount of $20&nbsp;million, which has been expensed pending appeals.
Following a change in the law governing the definition of willfulness, the Court issued a tentative
ruling that the jury&#146;s finding of willfulness and inducement should be vacated. After a hearing on
October&nbsp;15, 2007, the Court requested additional briefings by both parties, including briefing on
the question of whether the damages awarded

that the Court would postpone any decision on an appropriate injunction remedy pending its final
decision on the jury&#146;s finding of willfulness. The Court&#146;s final ruling on these issues and the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;14, 2006, an ITC hearing also commenced as to three patents alleged by Broadcom to
be infringed by the Company. On October&nbsp;10, 2006, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&nbsp;issued an
initial determination in which he recommended against any downstream remedies and found no
infringement by the Company on two of the three remaining patents and most of the asserted claims
of the third patent. The ALJ did find infringement on some claims of one patent. The ALJ did not
recommend excluding chips accused by Broadcom but, instead, recommended a limited exclusion order
directed only to chips that are already programmed with a specific software module and recommended
a related cease and desist order. The Commission adopted the ALJ&#146;s initial determination on
violation and, on June&nbsp;7, 2007, issued a cease and desist order and an exclusion order directed at
chips programmed with specific software and certain downstream products first imported after the
date of the exclusion order. The Federal Circuit has issued stays of the exclusion order with
respect to the downstream products of all of the Company&#146;s customers that requested the stay. The
Company is appealing both the infringement finding and the cease and desist order and the exclusion
order to the United States Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit. On April&nbsp;13, 2007, Broadcom filed a new complaint in California state court
against the Company alleging unfair competition, breach of contract and fraud,
and seeking injunctive and monetary relief. On October&nbsp;5, 2007, the Court ordered the case
stayed pending resolution of the New Jersey case, referenced above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation: </I>On October&nbsp;14, 2005, the Company filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom
alleging infringement of two patents, each of which relates to video encoding and decoding for
high-end multimedia processing, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon.
In January&nbsp;2007, a jury rendered a verdict finding the patents valid but not infringed. In a
subsequent ruling, the trial judge held that the Company was not guilty of inequitable conduct
before the Patent Office but the Company&#146;s actions in a video-encoding standards development
organization amounted to a waiver of the right to enforce the patents under any circumstances. The
Court also ordered Qualcomm to pay Broadcom&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees and costs for the case. Qualcomm and
Broadcom have each filed notices of appeal. The Court is also considering a motion for discovery
sanctions against Qualcomm for failing to produce certain documents in discovery.

November&nbsp;4, 2005, the Company, along with its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, filed an action
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Nokia alleging
infringement of eleven Qualcomm patents and one SnapTrack patent relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE and
position location and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On May&nbsp;24, 2006, the Company
filed an action in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for England and Wales against
Nokia alleging infringement of two Qualcomm patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE, seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief. On June&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed a complaint with the ITC against
Nokia alleging importation of products that infringe six Qualcomm patents relating to power
control, video encoding and decoding, and power conservation mode technologies and seeking an
exclusionary order and a cease and desist order. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, the ITC commenced an
investigation. The Company subsequently withdrew three of the patents from the proceedings. The ITC
trial was completed in September&nbsp;2007. The date for an initial determination from the ITC ALJ is
December&nbsp;12, 2007, and the target date for resolution of the investigation is April&nbsp;14, 2008. On
August&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed an action in the District Court of Dusseldorf, Federal Republic
of Germany, against Nokia alleging infringement of two Qualcomm patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE,
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed an action in
the High Court of Paris, France against Nokia alleging infringement of two patents relating to
GSM/GPRS/EDGE, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company
filed an action in the Milan Court, Italy against Nokia alleging infringement of two patents
relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In February&nbsp;2007, the
Company initiated proceedings in the People&#146;s Republic of China against Nokia for infringement of
three patents by Nokia&#146;s GSM/GPRS/EDGE products. On April&nbsp;2, 2007, the Company filed suit against
Nokia in the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division for infringement of two patents and in
the Western District of Wisconsin for infringement of three patents. These cases are directed to
Nokia GSM/GPRS/EDGE cellular phones. In response, Nokia filed counterclaims alleging infringement
by the Company of six Nokia patents, two of which Nokia also asserted against the

2007, the Company and MediaFLO USA, Inc. filed a motion to stay Nokia&#146;s infringement counterclaims
pending the arbitration proceeding filed on April&nbsp;5, 2007, discussed below. On July&nbsp;11, 2007, the
Wisconsin Court issued an order transferring that case to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California and the parties have consolidated the matter with the San Diego
matter referenced above and stipulated to a stay of the proceedings pending final resolution of the
ITC matter referenced above. On April&nbsp;5, 2007, the Company filed an arbitration demand with the
American Arbitration Association requesting a ruling that, among other things, Nokia&#146;s continued
use of the Company&#146;s patents in Nokia&#146;s CDMA cellular handsets (including WCDMA) after April&nbsp;9,
2007 constitutes an election by Nokia to extend its license under the parties&#146; existing agreement.
On July&nbsp;9, 2007, the Company filed an amended demand for arbitration, alleging that Nokia&#146;s
institution of certain patent infringement proceedings against the Company was a material breach of
the license agreement between the parties.

Corporation and Nokia Inc. filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court seeking declaratory and
injunctive relief relating to alleged commitments made by the Company to wireless industry
standards setting organizations. The Company has moved to dismiss the complaint. On April&nbsp;12, 2007
and June&nbsp;5, 2007, the Company filed counterclaims
seeking declarations that, among other things, the Company&#146;s 2001 license agreement with Nokia
fulfilled and/or superseded any ostensible obligations to offer or grant patent licenses to Nokia
allegedly arising from the Company&#146;s participation in certain standards setting organizations. Both
parties have moved to dismiss the other&#146;s complaints. In March&nbsp;2007, Nokia filed actions in Germany
and the Netherlands alleging that certain of the Company&#146;s patents are exhausted with regards to
Nokia&#146;s products placed on the European market that contain chipsets supplied to Nokia by Texas
Instruments. On October&nbsp;23, 2007, the German court dismissed Nokia&#146;s claims. On August&nbsp;16, 2007,
Nokia Corporation and Nokia Inc. filed a complaint with the United States International Trade
Commission (ITC)&nbsp;alleging importation of products that infringe five Nokia patents and seeking an
exclusionary order and a cease and desist order. The ITC instituted an investigation on September
17, 2007. The Company filed a motion to terminate the investigation pending resolution of the
arbitration proceeding instituted by the Company on April&nbsp;5,
2007. On October&nbsp;18, 2007, the ALJ
issued an order recommending the Company&#146;s motion be granted. The ALJ&#146;s determination will become
the ITC&#146;s final decision unless the ITC decides within 30&nbsp;days to review the decision.

(Broadcom, Nokia, Texas Instruments, NEC, Panasonic and Ericsson) filed complaints with the
European Commission, alleging that the Company violated European Union competition law in its WCDMA
licensing practices. The Company has received the complaints and has submitted replies to the
allegations, as well as documents and other information requested by the European Commission. On
October&nbsp;1, 2007, the European Commission announced that it was initiating a proceeding, though it
has not decided to issue a Statement of Objections, and it has not made any conclusions as to the
merits of the complaints.

infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of Texas and a
complaint with the United States ITC pursuant to Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against the
Company and other companies, alleging infringement of two patents relating to semiconductor
packaging structures and seeking monetary damages and injunctive and other relief based hereon. The
ITC instituted the investigation on May&nbsp;15, 2007. On July&nbsp;11, 2007, the ITC issued an order that
set August&nbsp;21, 2008 as the target date for completion of the investigation.

wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in several purported class
action lawsuits, and individually filed actions pending in Pennsylvania and Washington D.C.,

similar claims against other companies to date have held that there was insufficient scientific
basis for the plaintiffs&#146; claims in those cases.

of South Korean anti-trust regulations. To date, the Company has not received the complaints but
has submitted information and documents to the Korea Fair Trade Commission.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>QUALCOMM Incorporated<BR>
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japan Fair Trade Commission has also received unspecified complaints alleging the
Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation of Japanese law. The Company has not
received the complaints but has submitted information and documents to the Japan Fair Trade
Commission.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the claims made by other parties are without merit and will
vigorously defend the actions. Other than amounts relating to the <I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM
Incorporated </I>and <I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation </I>matters, the Company has not
recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the other legal proceedings
described above, based on the Company&#146;s belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not
probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. The Company is
engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business and believes
that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its operating
results, liquidity or financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Purchase Obligations. </I></B>The Company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase
inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets and estimates its noncancelable
obligations under these agreements for fiscal 2008 to 2012 to be approximately $760&nbsp;million, $118
million, $75&nbsp;million, $59&nbsp;million and $32&nbsp;million, respectively, and $8&nbsp;million thereafter. Of
these amounts, commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories for fiscal 2008 and
2009 comprised $586&nbsp;million and $29&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Leases. </I></B>The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under noncancelable
operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 30&nbsp;years and with provisions for
cost-of-living increases with certain leases. Rental expense for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $60
million, $47&nbsp;million and $39&nbsp;million, respectively. The Company leases certain property under
capital lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2038. Capital lease obligations are
included in other liabilities. The future minimum lease payments for all capital leases and
operating leases as of September&nbsp;30, 2007 are as follows (in millions):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reassessed the intersegment royalty
charged to QCT by QTL and determined that the royalty should be eliminated starting in fiscal 2007
for management reporting purposes to, among other reasons, recognize other value that QTL has
increasingly been realizing from QCT. As a result, QCT did not record a royalty to QTL in fiscal
2007, and prior period segment information has been adjusted in the same manner for comparative
purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company also reorganized the Qualcomm Wireless
Systems (QWS)&nbsp;division, which sells products and services to Globalstar, into the QES division in
the QWI segment. Revenues and operating results related to the QWS business were included in other
nonreportable segments as a component of reconciling items through the end of fiscal 2006. Prior
period segment information has been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings (loss)&nbsp;before income
taxes (EBT). EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including
depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and
charges are not allocated to segments in the Company&#146;s management reports because they are not
considered in evaluating the segments&#146; operating performance. Unallocated income and charges
include certain investment income, certain share-based compensation and certain research and
development expenses and marketing expenses that were not deemed to be directly related to the
businesses of the segments. The table below presents revenues, EBT and total assets for reportable
segments (in millions):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2007, the Company acquired three businesses for total cash consideration of $178
million. An additional $6&nbsp;million in consideration payable in cash through June&nbsp;2008 was held back
as security for certain indemnification obligations. The Company is in the process of finalizing
the accounting for the acquisitions and does not anticipate material adjustments to the preliminary
purchase price allocations. Goodwill recognized in
these transactions, of which $21&nbsp;million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, was
assigned to the QCT and QWI segments in the amounts of $74&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million, respectively.
Technology-based intangible assets recognized in the amount of $46&nbsp;million are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a weighted-average useful life of 3&nbsp;years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;18, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding capital
stock of Flarion Technologies, Inc. (Flarion), a privately held developer of OFDMA technology for
approximately $613&nbsp;million in consideration. Upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones
during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company incurred additional aggregate consideration of
$195&nbsp;million. Total consideration consisted of approximately $414&nbsp;million in cash (of which $75
million was paid in fiscal 2007), $357&nbsp;million in shares of QUALCOMM stock (of which $3&nbsp;million was
issued in fiscal 2007) and the exchange of Flarion&#146;s existing vested options and warrants with an
estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $37&nbsp;million. In addition, the Company assumed
Flarion&#146;s existing unvested options with an estimated aggregate fair value of $68&nbsp;million, which is

Company also acquired two other entities for a total cost of $73&nbsp;million, including $4&nbsp;million paid

Goodwill recognized in these three transactions, no amount of which is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes, was assigned to the QTL and QCT segments in the amounts of $616&nbsp;million and $42

no future alternative uses existed.

which was paid primarily in cash. Goodwill recognized in these transactions amounted to $220
million, of which $81&nbsp;million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was assigned
to the QMT, QIS and QCT segments in the amounts of $128&nbsp;million, $81&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million,
