<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication technique called CDMA
could be commercially successful in wireless communication applications. CDMA stands for Code
Division Multiple Access and is one of the main technologies currently used in digital wireless
communications networks. CDMA and the other main digital wireless communications technologies, TDMA
(which stands for Time Division Multiple Access) and GSM (which is a form of TDMA and stands for
Global System for Mobile Communications) are the digital technologies used to transmit a wireless
phone user&#146;s voice or data over radio waves using the wireless phone operator&#146;s network. CDMA works
by converting speech into digital information, which is then transmitted in the form of a radio
signal over the phone network. These digital wireless phone networks are complete phone systems
comprised primarily of base stations, or &#147;cells,&#148; which are geographically placed throughout a
service or coverage area. Once communication between a wireless phone user and a base station is
established, the system detects the movement of the wireless phone user and the communication is
handed off to another base station, or cell, as the wireless phone user moves throughout the
service area.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we led, and continue to lead, the development and commercialization of all versions of
CDMA technology, we own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications
and trade secrets, portions of which we license to other companies and implement in our own
products. The wireless communications industry generally recognizes that a company seeking to
develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technology will require a patent license
from us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several versions of CDMA technology recognized worldwide as public cellular
standards. The first version, known as cdmaOne, is a second generation (2G) cellular technology
that was first commercially deployed in

of mobile broadband data services. 3GPP2 standards are evolving beyond EV-DO Revision A to offer
much higher broadband data rates through Revision B and Revision C. Revision B enables CDMA
operators to upgrade their networks through software upgrades to support transmissions to a single
handset using multiple carriers to increase the data rates (in a 5 MHz bandwidth, more than three
times the data rate). Revision C will enable an OFDMA/CDMA path for delivering ultra mobile
broadband data rates using up to 20 MHz channels in new and vacant spectrum. In a system using 20
MHz bandwidths on both the uplink and downlink, uplink rates are greater
than 50 Mbps and downlink rates are greater than 100 Mbps with two base station antennas and
two handset antennas. With the same bandwidths and with four antennas at both the base station and
handset, downlink rates greater than 200 Mpbs can be obtained. The data rates will be less with
lower bandwidths. 3GPP standards are also evolving beyond current HSDPA and HSUPA through Release 7
and Release 8 to offer Evolved HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) or HSPA&#043; technologies to enable much
higher broadband data rates. In parallel, 3GPP is also introducing an
OFDMA-based air-interface
through its Long Term Evolution (LTE)&nbsp;to deliver ultra mobile broadband data rates using channel
bandwidths up to 20 MHz. These standards also enable end-to-end IP transport using advanced IP
Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)&nbsp;platform to deliver voice (VoIP), multimedia and other broadband data

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of
their existing services, offer these services more affordably, and introduce new revenue-generating
broadband data services well ahead of their competition. CDMA network service providers also
benefit from these innovations through increased numbers of subscribers, handset replacements and
increased annual revenues per user.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi, are complementary to Wide Area Networks
(WAN), such as CDMA2000 and WCDMA. They both provide affordable high-speed wireless access to the
Internet. The limited coverage offered by Wi-Fi is well suited for private networks (e.g.
enterprises, campuses and homes) and certain public &#147;hot spots&#148; (e.g. airports, conference halls
and coffee shops) where data usage is expected to be high in a limited portable and stationary
environment; whereas, 3G CDMA networks are ideally suited for geographically diverse voice and data
coverage (e.g. cities, highways and neighborhoods) and in environments where public access to the
Wi-Fi network is blocked due to a firewall (e.g. a client&#146;s enterprise). We may incorporate this
OFDM-based standard into our future multimode 3G CDMA chipsets as we continue to identify and
integrate other complementary wireless technologies into our chipsets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also developing our MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS)&nbsp;and OFDM-based FLO
technology to optimize the low cost delivery of multimedia content to multiple wireless subscribers
simultaneously, otherwise known as multicasting. As part of the standardization of FLO technology,
the FLO Forum (www.floforum.org) was established in fiscal 2005. To date, more than 65 companies
have joined the FLO Forum, including leaders from across the mobile content distribution industry.
In 2005, the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)&nbsp;established a Committee to develop
standards for Terrestrial Mobile Multimedia Multicast. In August&nbsp;2006, TIA published the Standard
Forward Link Only Air Interface Specification that was based upon the FLO Forum&#146;s submissions, thus
standardizing the lower layers of the FLO air interface.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our subsidiary, MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), plans to deploy and operate a nationwide
multicast network based on our MDS and FLO technology. MediaFLO USA
will use 700 megahertz (MHz) spectrum for
which we hold licenses for a nationwide footprint to deliver high-quality video and audio
programming to wireless subscribers in the United States. Additionally, MediaFLO USA plans to
procure, aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will make available on a
wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers (whether they operate on CDMA or GSM/WCDMA
networks) in the United States. MediaFLO USA will require minimal access to third generation
networks (CDMA or WCDMA) operated by our wireless operator customers for activities such as
subscription management. We believe that the service provided by MediaFLO USA will serve to
complement many of the wireless operators&#146; third generation network service offerings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MediaFLO USA continues to prepare for the launch of its commercial service. Its San Diego
Broadcast Operation Center and Network Operations Center are currently operating, while
construction of the initial phase of its network is nearing completion in several major markets. In
addition to Verizon Wireless, which announced its intention to launch the MediaFLO USA service in
early calendar 2007, MediaFLO USA is actively engaged in discussions with multiple domestic
wireless operators on how they might utilize the MediaFLO USA service.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of the United States, we continue to see interest in FLO technology. In May&nbsp;2006, we
signed a nonbinding letter of intent with British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) to conduct the first
technical trials of MediaFLO technology in the United Kingdom. The trial features 10 channels of BSkyB content
and a small number of non-commercial devices provided by us. The BSkyB technical trial is the first
of what we expect will be a number of FLO technology trials in Europe and other parts of the world.
In Japan, we formed a joint venture with KDDI to explore
the deployment of MediaFLO services, and Softbank (which acquired Vodafone KK) is setting up a
new company called Mobile Media Planning Corp. to conduct a technical study of MediaFLO and plan a
new service using MediaFLO technology.

active support of CDMA-based technologies, products and network operations to grow our royalty
revenues and integrated circuit and software revenues. We also plan to continue to broadly grant
royalty-bearing licenses to our patented technologies (including CDMA and OFDMA) and software
applications under terms and conditions that are fair, reasonable and free from unfair

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the tremendous demand for wireless voice services, wireless service providers
are increasingly focused on providing broadband wireless access to the Internet, as well as
multimedia entertainment, messaging, mobile commerce and position location services. These services
have been aided by the development and commercialization of 3G wireless networks and 3G handsets
which are capable of supporting higher data rates that incorporate an ever-increasing array of new
features and functionality, such as assisted GPS-based position location, digital cameras with
flash and zoom capabilities, internet browsers, email, interactive games, music and video downloads
and software download capability (e.g. our BREW platform). In June&nbsp;2006, the Yankee Group, a
global market intelligence and advisory firm in the technology and telecommunications industries,
estimated that more than 1.9&nbsp;billion people will be using mobile data services by 2010 and the
revenue produced from these services will account for 23% of total service revenue worldwide. We
believe the growing availability of 3G-enabled handsets capable of performing a wide variety of
consumer and enterprise applications
will accelerate the demand for many wireless data services on a global basis and thus lead to
an increased replacement rate of mobile devices to those using our technologies and integrated
circuits. Affordable wireless broadband data connectivity is important to the consumer and
enterprise, and its demand will continue to drive the evolution of wireless standards.

economic criteria and the service provider&#146;s evaluation of each technology&#146;s ability to provide the
features and functionality required for its business plan. More than a decade and a half ago, the
European Community developed regulations requiring the use of a telecommunication standard known as
Global System for Mobile Communications, commonly referred to as GSM, a TDMA-based technology.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant growth in the use of wireless phones worldwide and demand for enhanced network
functionality requires constant innovation to further improve network reliability, expand capacity
and introduce new types of services. To meet these requirements, progressive generations of
wireless telecommunications technology standards have evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>First Generation. </I></B>The first generation of wireless telecommunications, widely deployed by the
late 1980s in most of the developed world, was based on analog technology. While this generation
helped introduce the adoption of cellular wireless telecommunications by some business and consumer
users, the technology was characterized by inherent capacity limitations, minimal or no data
transfer capabilities, lack of privacy, inconsistent service levels and significant power
consumption.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Second Generation. </I></B>As the deployment of mobile phone systems grew, the limitations of analog
technology drove the development of second generation, digital-based technologies. Second
generation digital technology provided for significantly enhanced efficiency within a fixed
spectrum as well as greatly increased voice capacity compared to analog systems. Second generation
technologies also enabled numerous enhanced services, including paging, e-mail, facsimile,
connections to computer networks, greater privacy, lower prices, a greater number of service
options and greater fraud protection. However, data services (email, fax, computer connections)
were generally limited to low speed transmission rates. The main second-generation digital cellular
technologies are CDMA, called cdmaOne or IS-95A/B, a technology we developed and patented, North
American TDMA, PDC (Personal Digital Cellular&#151;a variant of North American TDMA), and GSM, also a
form of TDMA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advantages of CDMA technology over both analog and TDMA- and GSM-based
technologies include increased network capacity, network flexibility, compatibility with Internet
protocols, higher capacity for data and faster access to data (Internet), higher data throughput
rates and easier transition to 3G networks. GSM has the benefits of roaming due to its wider
worldwide deployment, and, for the near term, lower priced low-end handsets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of GSM operators deployed 2.5G mobile packet data technologies, such as GPRS and EDGE
(Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) in areas serviced by GSM, as a bridging technology, while
they waited for 3G WCDMA devices to become more readily available and affordable so they can
justify the expense of upgrading their GSM system to provide WCDMA service. In some regions of the
world, regulatory restrictions prevent deploying WCDMA in the lower frequency bands used by GSM,
thus requiring more cell sites for WCDMA to provide coverage. As a result, in less dense areas,
some operators have not deployed WCDMA. From a technological perspective, we do not believe that
GPRS and EDGE effectively compete with 3G CDMA-based packet data services, either on a cost per bit
or transmitted performance basis<B>.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Third Generation. </I></B>As a result of demand for wireless networks that simultaneously carry both
high speed data and voice traffic, several 3G wireless standards were proposed to the ITU by a
variety of SDOs. These proposals included both CDMA- and TDMA-based technologies. A technology
standard selected for 3G must efficiently
support significantly increased data speeds and increased voice and data capacity, thereby
enabling new and enhanced services and applications such as mobile e-commerce, position location
and mobile multimedia web browsing, including music and video downloads.

utilizes signals from both the GPS satellite constellation and CDMA cell sites, enables CDMA system
operators to meet the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&nbsp;mandate requiring wireless operators
to implement enhanced 911 (E911) wireless emergency location services and offer other commercial
location-based services. In the future, updates of CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO are expected to further
increase performance. Other enhancements, such as multicast services, higher-resolution displays,
longer battery life, push-to-talk services and Voice over Internet Protocol are becoming available
to improve the user experience and operator profitability. The price differential between low-end
third generation CDMA2000 handsets and GSM handsets is diminishing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1X began in South Korea in October&nbsp;2000. CDMA2000 1xEV-DO
was first commercially launched in January&nbsp;2002 with SKT&#146;s high-speed mobile multimedia and
broadcast service called &#147;June,&#148; and KTF also launched 1xEV-DO later the same year. Other prominent
carriers, such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel in the United States, KDDI in Japan, VIVO in
Brazil and Telecom New Zealand, have deployed 1xEV-DO network equipment in numerous markets and are
expanding coverage nationwide. CDMA2000 1xEV-DO subscribers are expected to continue to grow as
more operators begin to offer the service and the cost of providing the wireless broadband service
becomes more affordable and attractive through lower cost handsets, additional network
enhancements, the embedding of the technology into laptops and increased competition between
operators. Currently, major laptop computer companies, including Lenovo, Dell, HP, Toshiba and
Panasonic, have products incorporating 1xEV-DO technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Community and Cingular, a United States carrier, have focused primarily on the
UTRA-FDD radio interface of the IMT-2000 standard, known as WCDMA, which is based on our underlying
CDMA technology and incorporates many of our patented inventions (as are all of the CDMA radio
interfaces of the IMT-2000 Standard). The majority of the world&#146;s leading wireless phone and
infrastructure manufacturers (more than 70) have licensed our technology for use in WCDMA products,
enabling them to utilize this WCDMA mode of the 3G technology. This includes the following major
wireless equipment suppliers: Agilent, Alcatel, BenQ, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Kyocera, LG
Electronics, Lucent, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, Motorola, Pantech &#038; Curitel, NEC, Nokia, Nortel,
Novatel Wireless, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Siemens, Sierra Wireless and
Toshiba, among others. We expect significant growth in the WCDMA subscriber base over the next five years, driven by
Japan (led by NTT DoCoMo), Europe, China and the United States (led by Cingular); thus, we have
allocated a significant amount of engineering, production and business resources to support this large growth opportunity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three ITU 3G CDMA radio interfaces are all based on the underlying core principles of CDMA
technology; however, the CDMA2000 mode enables a direct and more economical conversion for current
cdmaOne networks. While the WCDMA wireless air interface does use CDMA technology for
communications between the wireless device and the network, the infrastructure network has been
specifically designed to be compatible with the GSM network, which is why it is expected that most
GSM operators will migrate to WCDMA rather than to CDMA2000<B>. </B>We will continue to develop integrated
circuits for CDMA2000 and WCDMA and expect to develop integrated circuits for all 3G versions based
on CDMA when commercially worthwhile. In addition, our intellectual property rights include a
valuable patent portfolio that includes patents essential to implementation of each of the 3G CDMA
alternative standards and patents that are useful for commercially successful product
implementations. Generally, we have licensed substantially all of our
patents to our CDMA
licensees. Under each of our existing license

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary plans to deploy and operate a nationwide multicast network in the
United States based on our MDS and FLO technology. MediaFLO USA will use 700 MHz spectrum for which
we hold licenses for a nationwide footprint to deliver high-quality video and audio programming to
wireless subscribers. Additionally, MediaFLO USA plans to procure, aggregate and distribute content
in service packages which we will make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator
customers (whether they operate on CDMA or GSM/WCDMA networks) in the United States. The commercial
availability of the MediaFLO network and service will be determined by our wireless operator
partners.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MediaFLO USA continues to prepare for the launch of its commercial service. Its San Diego
based Broadcast Operations Center and Network Operations Center are currently operating, while
construction of the initial phase of its network is nearing completion in several major markets. In
addition to Verizon Wireless, which announced its intention to launch the MediaFLO USA service
during early calendar 2007, MediaFLO USA is actively engaged in discussions with multiple domestic
wireless operators on how they might utilize the MediaFLO USA service.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology to enable MediaFLO USA and potentially
other international operators to optimize the low cost delivery of multimedia content to multiple
wireless subscribers simultaneously. Our efforts to sell this technology internationally will be
conducted by a nonreportable segment and not by MediaFLO USA or QSI. The MDS will provide wireless
network operators the ability to enhance their multimedia service offering capabilities via
efficient scheduling and delivery of multimedia content. Wireless network operators can utilize the
MDS with their current unicast networks and with multicast networks, which are soon to be
available, operating on CDMA2000 1xEV-DO or WCDMA. The MDS is not air interface specific and thus
can be utilized by CDMA2000, WCDMA and FLO technology operators alike. FLO is a multicast air
interface technology specifically designed for markets where dedicated spectrum is available and
where regulations permit high-power transmission, thereby reducing the number of towers and related
infrastructure required to provide market coverage. MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology are
complementary to existing wireless networks because interactive services are supported within the
mobile device using the CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO or WCDMA wireless link. Furthermore, the MediaFLO MDS
can seamlessly integrate multicasting services provided over 3G operator networks with such
services provided over a stand-alone FLO network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our strategic investment activities, we may consider various corporate structuring
and exit strategies at some point in the future, which may include distribution of our ownership
interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a spin-off transaction.

consumer-targeted mobile products. QMT&#146;s interferometric modular display (iMoD) technology, based
on a micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS)&nbsp;structure combined with thin film optics, is expected
to provide substantial performance, power consumption and cost benefits as compared to current
display technologies. We expect the iMoD product to deliver a vivid and realistic display image
quality that can withstand extreme temperatures and be viewed in virtually any environment,
including bright sunlight. Displays have become a key factor in the overall power consumption of
wireless devices, with the increasing use of vibrant color screens and multimedia applications that
generate rapidly changing images. The iMoD product is expected to offer significantly lower power
consumption than existing display products, thereby extending the battery life of wireless devices.
With the inclusion of color displays in all types of wireless phones, including models at the low
end of the market, the cost of the display has become an even more significant factor in the
overall cost of the handset. An iMoD display
should cost less to manufacture than a comparable liquid crystal display because it requires
fewer components and processing steps, thus enabling advanced multimedia capabilities on all tiers
of mobile devices.

competes worldwide with a number of United States and international semiconductor designers and
manufacturers in the United States and internationally. As a result of the trend toward a larger
CDMA wireless market, global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological
changes, we anticipate that additional competitors will enter this market. We believe that the
principal competitive factors for CDMA integrated circuit
providers to our addressed markets are product performance, level of integration, quality,
compliance with industry standards, price, time-to-market, system cost, design and engineering
capabilities, new product innovation and customer support. The specific bases on which we compete
against alternative CDMA integrated circuit providers vary by product platform. We also compete in
both single and dual-mode environments against alternative wireless communications technologies
including, but not limited to, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, TDMA, WiMax and analog.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT&#146;s current competitors include major semiconductor companies such as Freescale, Infineon,
NEC, Philips, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom, as well as major
telecommunication equipment companies such as Ericsson, Matsushita, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung,
who design their own integrated circuits and software for certain products. QCT also faces
competition from some start-up ventures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitors may devote a significantly greater amount of their financial, technical,
marketing and other resources to aggressively market competitive telecommunications systems or to
develop and adopt competitive digital cellular technologies, and those efforts may materially and
adversely affect QCT. Moreover, competitors may offer more attractive product pricing or financing
terms than we do as a means of gaining access to the wireless telecommunications markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have entered into licensing agreements with certain companies, including EoNex
Technologies, Infineon, Lucent, Motorola, NEC, Philips, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom. These
licenses permit the licensees to manufacture CDMA-based integrated circuits using certain of our
intellectual property for sale to CDMA-based phone manufacturers. In exchange for granting the
licenses, we are entitled to receive license fees, royalties (determined as a percentage of the
selling price of the integrated circuits) and/or royalty-free cross-licenses, which allow us to use
these companies&#146; CDMA and, in some cases, non-CDMA intellectual property for specified purposes. In
every case, the phone manufacturers&#146; sales of CDMA-based phones are subject to the payment of
royalties to us on the products into which the integrated circuits are incorporated in accordance
with the manufacturers&#146; separate licensing arrangements with us. We license our CDMA intellectual

competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless
communications technology and services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a worldwide basis, we currently compete primarily with the GSM/GPRS/EDGE digital wireless
telecommunications technologies. GSM has been extensively utilized in Europe, much of Asia other
than Japan and South Korea, and certain other markets. To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than
CDMA, however, CDMA technologies have been adopted for all third generation wireless systems. In
addition, most GSM operators have deployed GPRS, a packet data technology, as a 2.5G bridge
technology, and a number of GSM operators have deployed or are expected to deploy EDGE, while
waiting for third generation WCDMA to become available and/or more cost effective for their system.
A limited number of operators have started testing OFDMA technology, a multi-carrier transmission
technique not based on CDMA technology, which divides the available spectrum into many carriers,
with each carrier being modulated at a low data rate relative to the combined rate for all
carriers. We have invested in the development of our own OFDMA technology and intellectual property
and have acquired Flarion, a major developer and patent holder of OFDMA technology.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this
Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described
below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the
following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case,
the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information
set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Businesses</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>If CDMA and CDMA-related technology deployment does not expand as anticipated, our revenues may not
grow as anticipated.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus our business primarily on developing, patenting and commercializing CDMA technology
for wireless telecommunications applications. In addition, with the acquisition of Flarion, we
expect an increased emphasis on developing, patenting and commercializing OFDMA technology. Other
digital wireless communications technologies, particularly GSM technology, have been more widely
deployed than CDMA technology. OFDMA has not been widely deployed commercially. Notwithstanding our
portfolio of OFDM/OFDMA intellectual property, technology and products, if CDMA technology does not
become the preferred wireless communications industry standard in the countries where our products
and those of our customers and licensees are sold, our business and financial results could suffer.
If wireless operators do not select CDMA for their networks or update their current networks to any
CDMA-based third generation (3G) technology, our business and financial results could suffer since
we generally have not generated revenues from GSM product sales, and there is no assurance that our
OFDM/OFDMA patent portfolio will be as valuable as our CDMA portfolio or that our OFDMA chipset
business will be as successful as our CDMA chipset business. Further, if OFDMA technology is not
adopted and deployed commercially, our investment in Flarion and OFDMA technology may not provide
us an adequate return on our investment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase our revenues in future periods, we are dependent upon the commercial deployment of
3G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA technology. Although
wireless network operators have commercially deployed CDMA2000 and WCDMA, we cannot predict the
timing or success of further commercial deployments or expansions of CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA
systems. If existing deployments are not commercially successful or do not continue to grow their
subscriber base, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA-based systems
are delayed or unsuccessful, our business and financial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">results may be harmed. In addition, our
business could be harmed if wireless network operators deploy competing technologies or switch
existing networks from CDMA to GSM without upgrading to WCDMA or if wireless network operators
introduce new technologies. A limited number of operators have started testing OFDMA technology,
but there can be no assurance that OFDMA will be adopted or deployed commercially or that we will
be successful in developing and marketing OFDMA products. Although the acquisition of Flarion
brings us an additional and very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to
OFDMA technology, and, prior to the acquisition, we had hundreds of issued or pending patents
relating to applications of GPRS, EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA and multi in, multi out (MIMO), there can be no
assurance that our patent portfolio in these areas would be as valuable as our CDMA portfolio.
Sprint Nextel has indicated that it is planning to deploy WiMax (an OFDMA based technology) in
its 2.5 Ghz spectrum, also known as the Broadband Radio Services band. Other operators are
investigating deployment of WiMax. Although we believe that our patented technology is essential
and useful to implementation of the WiMax standard, there is no assurance that we will achieve the
same royalty revenue on such WiMax deployments as on CDMA or other technology deployments or that
we will achieve the same chipset market shares within a WiMax network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business and the deployment of our technologies, products and services are dependent on
the success of our customers, licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators, as well as the timing of
their deployment of new services. Our licensees and CDMA-based wireless operators may incur lower
operating margins on products or services based on our technologies than on products using
alternative technologies due to greater competition in the relevant market or other factors. If
CDMA-based wireless operators, phone and/or infrastructure manufacturers exit the CDMA-based
markets, the deployment of CDMA technology could be negatively affected, and our business could
suffer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Our three largest customers accounted for 39%, 39% and 40% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The loss of any one of our major customers or any reduction in the
demand for devices utilizing our CDMA technology could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to
achieve or sustain desired levels of operating results.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QCT Segment. </I>Three customers, LG Electronics, Motorola Inc. and Samsung Electronics Company,
constitute a significant portion of QCT&#146;s revenues such that the loss of any one of these customers
or the delay, even if only temporary, or cancellation of significant orders from any of these
customers would reduce our revenues in the period of the cancellation or deferral and harm our
ability to achieve or sustain acceptable levels of operating results. Accordingly, unless and until
our QCT segment diversifies and expands its customer base, our future success will significantly
depend upon the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers. Factors
that may impact the size and timing of orders from customers of our QCT segment include, among
others, the following:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QTL Segment. </I>Our QTL segment derives royalty revenues primarily from sales of CDMA products by
our licensees. Although we have more than 135 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our
royalty revenue from a limited number of licensees. Our future success depends upon the ability of
our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain
market acceptance. We have little or no control over the sales efforts of our licensees, and we
cannot assure you that our licensees will be successful or that the demand for wireless
communications devices and services offered by our licensees will continue to increase. Any
reduction in the demand for or any delay in the development, introduction or delivery of wireless
communications devices utilizing our CDMA technology could have a material adverse effect on our
business. Reductions in the average selling price of wireless communications devices utilizing our
CDMA technology, without a comparable increase in the volumes of such devices sold, could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Weakness in the value of foreign currencies in which our
customers&#146; products are sold may reduce the amount of royalties payable to us in U.S. dollars.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalties under our license agreements are generally payable to us for the life of the patents
that we license under our agreements. The licenses granted to and from us under a number of our
license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date,
and, in a small number of agreements, royalties are payable on those patents for a specified time
period. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed
by or to us under our license agreements. In order to license any such later patents, we will need
to extend or modify our license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such
licensees. Although in the past we have amended many of our license agreements to include later
patents without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements, there is no
assurance that we will be able to modify our license agreements in the future to license any such
later patents or extend such date(s) to incorporate later patents without affecting the material
terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees. We have a license agreement
with Nokia Corp., which in part expires on April&nbsp;9, 2007. While the parties have been in
discussions to conclude an extension or a new license agreement beyond that time period, there is
no certainty as to when we will be able to conclude an agreement or the terms of any such
agreement. There is also a possibility that the parties will not be able to conclude a new or
extended agreement by April&nbsp;2007. In that event after April&nbsp;9, 2007, unless and until the existing
agreement is extended or a new agreement is concluded, Nokia&#146;s right to sell subscriber products
under most of our patents (including many that we have declared as essential to the CDMA, WCDMA and
other standards) and therefore Nokia&#146;s obligation to pay royalties to us will both cease under the
terms of the current agreement, and our rights to sell integrated circuits under Nokia&#146;s patents
will likewise cease under the terms of the current agreement. Please refer to our discussion below
under the subheadings entitled &#147;The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights
may be expensive and could divert our valuable resources&#148; and &#147;Claims by other companies that we
infringe their intellectual property, that patents on which we rely are invalid, or that our
business practices are in some way unlawful, could adversely affect our business&#148; and note that any
company that makes or sells products without a license under the applicable patents of another
company would be exposed to patent infringement litigation by such other company. The patent
holder, whether we or another company, would generally be entitled to seek all available legal
remedies including an injunction against making and selling products infringing such patent without
a license and damages for past unlicensed sales in the form of lost profits or a reasonable royalty
(which damages may be trebled for willful infringement).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our patents apply to multiple technologies, such as GPRS, EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA
(including WiMax) and MIMO, there can be no assurance that our patent portfolio will generate
licensing income or be as valuable in generating licensing income with respect to other
technologies, as compared to CDMA-based technologies.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Efforts by some telecommunications equipment manufacturers and component suppliers to avoid paying
fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may create uncertainty about
our future business prospects, may require the investment of substantial management time and
financial resources, and may result in legal decisions and/or political actions by foreign
governments that harm our business.</I>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation.
These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to wireless
technology. Because all commercially deployed forms of CDMA and their derivatives require the use
of our patents, our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed portfolio in the
industry with over 135 licensees. Over the years a number of companies have challenged our patent
position but at this time most, if not all, companies recognize that any

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">to develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technologies will
require a patent license from us. Notwithstanding the strength of this intellectual property
position, we have a policy of, and have succeeded in, licensing our technology to all interested
companies on terms that are fair, reasonable and free from unfair discrimination. Unlike some other
companies in our industry that hold back certain key technologies, we offer interested companies
the opportunity to license essentially our entire patent portfolio. Our broad licensing strategy
has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a wide range of companies offering a
broad array of wireless products and features while driving down average and low-end selling prices
for 3G handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing a wide range of equipment manufacturers,
encouraging innovative applications, supporting equipment manufacturers with a total chipset and
software solution, and focusing on improving the efficiency of the airlink for operators, we have
helped 3G CDMA evolve, grow, and reduce handset pricing all at a faster pace than the second
generation technologies that preceded it (e.g. GSM).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having failed in their efforts to challenge the strength of our intellectual property position
and, in most cases, despite contracts with us that were freely and fairly negotiated and contain
fair and reasonable royalty provisions, a small number of companies have now initiated various
strategies in an attempt to renegotiate, mitigate and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to
us for the use of our intellectual property in order to negatively affect our business model and
that of our other licensees. These strategies have included (i)&nbsp;litigation, often alleging
infringement of patents held by such companies or unfair competition of some variety, (ii)&nbsp;taking
questionable positions on the interpretation of contracts with us, with royalty reduction as the
likely true motive, (iii)&nbsp;appeals to governmental authorities, such as the complaints filed with
the European Commission (EC) during the fourth calendar quarter of 2005 and the Korean Fair Trade
Commission during June&nbsp;2006, and (iv)&nbsp;lobbying with governmental regulators and elected officials
for the purpose of seeking the imposition of some form of compulsory licensing and/or to weaken a
patent holder&#146;s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were notified by the Competition Directorate of the EC&nbsp;that six
companies (Nokia, Ericsson, Panasonic, Texas Instruments, Broadcom and NEC) submitted separate
formal complaints accusing our business practices, with respect to licensing of patents and sales
of chipsets, to be in violation of Article&nbsp;82 of the EC treaty. We received the complaints and have
submitted a response. While we believe that none of our business practices violate the legal
requirements of Article&nbsp;82 of the EC treaty, if the EC decides to formally investigate these
accusations and determines liability as to any of the alleged violations, it could impose fines
and/or require us to modify our practices. Further, such an investigation could be expensive and
time consuming to address, divert management attention from our business and harm our reputation.
Although such potential adverse findings may be appealed within the EC legal system, an adverse
final determination could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and/or earnings. We
also understand that two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and Broadcom) and two South Korean companies
(Nextreaming Corp. and THINmultimedia Inc.) have filed complaints with the Korean Fair Trade
Commission alleging that our business practices are, in some way, a violation of South Korean anti-trust
regulations. While we have not seen these complaints, we believe that none of our business
practices violate the legal requirements of South Korean competition law. However, any resulting
investigation in South Korea could be expensive and time consuming to address, divert management
attention from our business and harm our reputation. An adverse final determination on these
charges could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and/or earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given our substantial investment in technology innovation, the demonstrable benefits provided
by our intellectual property, and long-standing license agreements with more than 135 licensees
including many of the world&#146;s foremost wireless equipment manufacturers, we believe that our
royalty rates are reasonable and fair to the companies that benefit from our intellectual property
and provide significant incentives for others to invest in CDMA applications, as evidenced by the
significant growth in the CDMA portion of the wireless industry, the integration of new features
and functionality into CDMA wireless products, and the rapid reduction in the price of low-end CDMA
handsets over recent years. While the distractions caused by challenges to our business model and
licensing program are undesirable and the legal and other costs associated with defending our
position have been and continue to be significant, we believe that these challenges are without
merit, and we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights and our right to
continue to receive a fair return for our innovations. A recent ruling in New Jersey Federal
district court granted our motion to dismiss unfounded claims by Broadcom that our business
practices have been in violation of anti-trust law in the United
States. These business practices are essentially
the same as cited in the EC complaints. The court ruled that, assuming all the facts stated by
Broadcom are correct (which we believe is not the case), we have not violated any anti-trust laws.
This ruling is very
important and favorable. Broadcom has appealed it. Regrettably, we assume, as should
investors, that challenges of this nature will continue into the foreseeable future and may require
the investment of substantial management time and financial resources to explain and defend our
position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no guarantees as to the ultimate outcome of these challenges, we intend
to expend appropriate resources to educate governmental authorities, elected officials, courts of
law, our licensees, wireless service operators and the general public as to the true nature of
these disputes. We believe that when such information is fairly evaluated by such parties, these
challenges by the complainants to the EC will be seen for what they truly are, an
attempt to avoid paying the agreed upon and fair compensation for the use of our significant
intellectual property portfolio, and to extend their domination of the second generation wireless

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive and could
divert our valuable resources.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use
of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the
steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary
information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our
proprietary rights as fully or as readily as United States laws. We cannot be certain that the laws
and policies of any country, including the United States, or the practices of any of the
international standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property
enforcement or licensing, issuance of wireless licenses or the adoption of standards, will not be
changed in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or
technology. Within the United States Congress, committee work has been initiated to draft a &#147;patent
reform law.&#148; The end product of such work could be new patent legislation detrimental to our
licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technology. Any action we take to
influence such potential changes could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in
turn, could negatively impact our operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of our patents and patent applications relate to our wireless communications
technology and much of the remainder of our patents and patent applications relate to our other
technologies and products. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights,
protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a
result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur substantial unexpected
operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and
could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our
operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights could impair our brand
identity.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, that patents on which we
rely are invalid, or that our business practices are in some way unlawful, could adversely affect
our business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other
intellectual proprietary rights against our products or products using our technologies or other
technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted (see Item&nbsp;3. Legal Proceedings) and
may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given the
complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of
our products were found to infringe on another company&#146;s intellectual property rights, we could be
required to redesign our products or license such rights and/or pay damages or other compensation
to such other company. If we were unable to redesign our products or license such intellectual
property rights used in our products, we could be prohibited from making and selling such products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as the number of competitors in our market increases and the functionality of our
products is enhanced and overlaps with the products of other companies, we may become subject to
claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others. Any
claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation,
divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment
delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results. In any
potential dispute involving other companies&#146; patents or other intellectual property, our licensees
could also become the targets of litigation. Any such litigation could severely disrupt the
business of our licensees, which in turn could hurt our relations with our licensees and cause our
revenues to decrease.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other companies or entities also may commence actions seeking to establish the invalidity of
our patents. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court may invalidate
the patent or determine that the patent is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive
position. If any of our key patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these
patents is limited by court decision, we could be prevented from licensing the invalidated or
limited portion of such patents. Even if such a patent challenge is not successful, it could be
expensive and time consuming to address, divert management attention from our business and harm our
reputation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Successful attempts by certain companies to amend or modify Standards Development Organizations&#146;
(SDO&#146;s) intellectual property policies could impact our licensing business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our technologies, such as CDMA and OFDMA, are generally proposed and incorporated into
standards adopted by SDO&#146;s throughout the world (e.g. European Telecommunications Standards
Institute (ETSI), Telecommunications Industry Association, Telecommunications Technology
Association, IEEE, etc.). These SDO&#146;s have policies with respect to intellectual property
contributed by their member companies, which generally require member companies to commit to
license their patents essential to the practice of the adopted standard on terms and conditions
that are fair, reasonable and free from unfair discrimination (FRAND). We, as a member of these
SDO&#146;s and a significant contributor to a number of adopted standards, have made a number of FRAND
commitments. Some companies have proposed significant new SDO intellectual property policies, some
of which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all
essential patents owned by its member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product
implementing the adopted standard. They have further proposed that the maximum aggregate royalty
rate be apportioned to each member company with essential patents based upon the size of its
essential patent portfolio. Recently, NGMN Ltd., an industry standards development group organized
by several wireless operators, has invited other companies in the industry to participate within
NGMN Ltd. subject to IP restrictions substantially similar to these proposals. It is quite early in the
process of discussing and evaluating these proposals but we expect that, once all parties analyze
and understand the full impact of these proposals, they will come to understand that such proposals
are not in the best interests of the industry and would have serious undesirable consequences. For
example, these proposals, if adopted, would discourage research and
development investment, invention and innovation,
incentivize bulk filings of marginal patents, and encourage lobbying for introduction of needless
features into standards. Further, they would discriminate against companies that develop new
technology and enable other companies to manufacture and use products incorporating those new
technologies in favor of such manufacturers and users. We are participating in the process and
expect to channel it into useful improvements of the existing processes. Although the ETSI ad hoc
IPR group has determined that such proposals should not be adopted as amendments to existing ETSI
policies, there can be no assurance that such proposals as described above will not be adopted by
other SDO&#146;s or industry groups, such as the recently formed NGMN Ltd., resulting in a disadvantage
to our business model either by limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies
or forcing us to work outside of the SDO&#146;s or such other industry groups for promoting our new
technologies.

by their overall capacity and current capacity availability. Although we have entered into
long-term contracts with our suppliers, most of these contracts do not provide for long-term
capacity commitments. To the extent that we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a
specific time period, or in any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have
allocated, capacity to the production of products for their other customers while reducing capacity
to manufacture our products. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we
need it or available at reasonable prices. We have experienced capacity limitations from our
suppliers in the past and may experience it in the future. During fiscal 2004 and the first quarter
of fiscal 2005, we experienced supply constraints which resulted in our inability to meet certain
customer demand. While we were able to alleviate these supply constraints and improve the supply
and delivery of integrated circuits by working with our existing suppliers to increase available
manufacturing capacity, and by increasing and extending our firm orders to our suppliers, there can
be no assurance that we will not experience supply constraints in the future, which could result in
our failure to meet customer demand.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our goal is to establish alternate suppliers for technologies that we consider critical,
some of our integrated circuits products are only available from single sources, with which we do
not have long-term contracts. Our reliance on sole or limited-source vendors involves significant
risks including possible shortages of manufacturing capacity, poor product performance and reduced
control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity
and costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to general risks associated with our international sales, licensing activities and
operations, we are also subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we do
business. We cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country with respect to
intellectual property enforcement or licensing, issuance of wireless licenses or the adoption of
standards will not be changed or enforced in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to
the sale or use of our products or technology. Declines in currency values in selected regions may
adversely affect our operating results because our products and those of our customers and
licensees may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. During
fiscal 2006, 70% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in South Korea, Japan and
China, as compared to 69% during fiscal 2005 and 68% during fiscal 2004. These customers sell their
products to markets worldwide, including Japan, South Korea, China, India, North America, South
America and Europe. A significant downturn in the economies of Asian countries where many of our
customers and licensees are located, particularly the economies of South Korea, Japan and China, or
the economies of the major markets they serve would materially harm our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wireless markets in Brazil, China and India, among others, represent growth opportunities
for us. If wireless operators in Brazil, China or India, or the governments of Brazil, China or
India, make technology deployment or other decisions that result in actions that are adverse to the
expansion of CDMA technologies, our business could be harmed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide
subsidies on phone sales to their customers. Increases in phone prices that negatively impact phone
sales can result from changes in regulatory policies related to phone subsidies. Limitations or
changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have
additional negative impacts on our revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that royalty revenues from international licensees based upon sales of their
products outside of the United States will continue to represent a significant portion of our total
revenues in the future. Our royalty revenues from international licensees are denominated in U.S.
dollars. To the extent that such licensees&#146; products are sold in foreign currencies, any royalties
that we derive as a result of such sales are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In
addition, if the effective price of products sold by our customers were to increase as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall,
which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenue, harm our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we engage in acquisitions or strategic transactions with the goal of
maximizing stockholder value. We have acquired businesses, entered into joint ventures and made
strategic investments in or loans to CDMA wireless operators, early-stage companies, or venture
funds to support our business, including the global adoption of CDMA-based technologies and related
services. Most of our strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid
until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. We cannot provide assurance that
our acquisitions or strategic investments (either those we currently have completed or may
undertake in the future) will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased
adoption or continued use of our technologies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only

serious impact on our customers, which could damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships
and expose us to liability. Defects or impurities in our components, materials or software or those
used by our customers or licensees, equipment failures or other difficulties could adversely affect
our ability and that of our customers and licensees to ship products on a timely basis as well as
customer or licensee demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or declines in demand could
reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain desired levels of profitability. We
and our customers or licensees may also experience component or software failures or defects that
could require significant product recalls, reworks and/or repairs which are not covered by warranty
reserves and which could consume a substantial portion of the capacity of our third party
manufacturers or those of our customers or licensees. Resolving any defect or failure related
issues could consume financial and/or engineering resources that could affect future product
release schedules. Additionally, a defect or failure in our products or the products of our
customers or licensees could harm our reputation and/or adversely affect the growth of 3G wireless
markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our product complexities increase, we are required to migrate to integrated circuit
technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes such as 90nm, 65nm, etc. The design process
interface issues are more complex as we enter into these new domains of technology, which adds
risks on yield and reliability. In addition, the timely readiness of our foundry suppliers to
support such technology changes could impact our ability to meet customer demand, revenue, and cost
expectations. The timing of acceptance of the smaller technology designs by our customers may
subject us to the risk of excess inventories of earlier designs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global economic conditions can have wide-ranging effects on markets that we serve,
particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and wireless network operators. We
cannot predict negative events, such as war, that may have adverse effects on the economy or on
phone inventories at CDMA-based equipment manufacturers and operators. The continued threat of
terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future
acts of terrorism, may cause disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications
industry and create uncertainties. Recent reports suggest that inflation could have adverse
effects on the global economy and capital markets. Inflation could adversely affect our customers,
including their ability to obtain financing, upgrade wireless networks and purchase our products
and services, and our end consumers, by lowering their standards of living and diminishing their
ability to purchase wireless devices based on our technology. Inflation could also increase our
costs of raw materials and operating expenses and harm our business in other ways. Should such
negative events occur, subsequent economic recovery might not benefit us in the near term. If it
does not, our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired.
In addition, because we intend to continue to make significant investments in research and
development and to maintain extensive ongoing customer service and support capability, any decline
in the rate of growth of our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating
results.

enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in wireless telecommunications, the trend
toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy
changes and relatively low barriers to entry in selected segments of the industry.

competing CDMA-based integrated circuits are included amongst our competitors. Examples of such
competitors (some of whom are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Agere, Broadcom,
EoNex Technologies, Ericsson, Freescale, Fujitsu, Intel, NEC, Nokia, Samsung, Texas Instruments and
VIA Telecom. With respect to our QWBS business, our competitors are aggressively pricing products
and services and are offering new value-added products and services which may impact margins,
intensify competition in current and new markets and harm our ability to compete in certain
markets.

addition, we anticipate additional competitors will enter the market for products based on 3G
standards. These competitors may have more established relationships and distribution channels in
markets not currently deploying CDMA-based wireless communications technology. These competitors
also may have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or
with our existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may
affect our customers&#146; decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly,
new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market

business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth and/or increased their
international activities, placing significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial
resources. In order to manage growth and geographic expansion, we must continue to improve and
develop our management, operational and financial systems and controls, including quality control
and delivery and service capabilities. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our
employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and
inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology
transitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand
and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and licensees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, inaccuracies in our demand forecasts, or failure of the systems used to develop
the forecasts, could quickly result in either insufficient or excessive inventories and
disproportionate overhead expenses. If we ineffectively manage our growth or are unsuccessful in
recruiting and retaining personnel, our business and operating results will be harmed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past
and may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other conditions causing a
downturn in the market for our products or technology, and in turn affecting the timing of customer
orders or causing cancellations or rescheduling of orders, could also adversely affect our
operating results. Moreover, our customers may change delivery schedules, cancel or reduce orders
without incurring significant penalties and generally are not subject to minimum purchase
requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future operating results will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to:
our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated customers or licensees, both domestically and
internationally; our ability to develop, introduce and market new technology, products and services
on a timely basis; management of inventory by us and our customers and their customers in response
to shifts in market demand; changes in the mix of technology and products developed, licensed,
produced and sold; seasonal customer demand; the Flarion acquisition; and other factors described
elsewhere in this Annual Report and in these risk factors. Our cash investments represent a
significant asset that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon
interest rate movements and financial market conditions in fixed income and equity securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors affecting our future operating results are difficult to forecast and could harm
our quarterly and/or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the financial

continue to invest significant resources in developing integrated circuit products to support
high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork operation and multimedia
applications, which encompass development of graphical display, camera and video capabilities, as
well as higher computational capability and lower power on-chip computers and signal processors.
While our research and development activities have resulted in inventions relating to applications
of GPRS, EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA and MIMO, and hundreds of issued or pending patent applications, there
can be no assurance that our patent portfolio in these areas would be as valuable as our CDMA
portfolio. Further, if OFDMA technology is not adopted and deployed commercially, our investment in
Flarion and OFDMA technology may not provide us an adequate return on our investment. We also
continue to invest in the development of our BREW applications development platform, our MediaFLO
MDS and FLO technology and our iMoD display technology. All of these new products and technologies
face significant competition, and we cannot assure you that the revenues generated from these
products or the timing of the deployment of these products or technologies, which may be dependent
on the actions of others, will meet our expectations. We cannot be certain that we will make the
additional advances in development that may be essential to successfully commercialize our iMoD
technology.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;26, 2005, we adopted the revised statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
FAS 123 (FAS 123R), &#147;Share-Based Payment,&#148; which requires that we record compensation expense in
the statement of operations for share-based payments, such as employee stock options, using the
fair value method. The adoption of this new standard is expected to continue to have a significant
effect on our reported earnings, although it will not affect our cash flows, and could adversely
impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the
variability of the factors used to estimate the values of share-based payments. If factors change
and we employ different assumptions or different valuation methods in the application of FAS 123R
in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under FAS 123R may differ significantly
from what we have recorded in the current period, which could negatively affect our stock price and
our stock price volatility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our products and those of our licensees and
customers entail the risk of product liability. The use of wireless devices containing our products
to access un-trusted content creates a risk of exposing the system software in those devices to
viral or malicious attacks. We continue to expand our focus on this issue and take measures to
safeguard the software from this threat. However, this issue carries the risk of general product
liability along with the associated impacts on reputation and demand. Although we believe our
product liability insurance will be adequate to protect against product liability claims, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in
sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. Our inability to maintain
insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims
could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products and those of our licensees and
customers and harm our future operating results. Furthermore, not all losses associated with
alleged product failure are insurable. In addition, a product liability claim or recall, whether
against our licensees, customers, or us could harm our reputation and result in decreased demand
for our products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless
networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry
and adversely affect our business.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that
utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators
must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in
the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated
to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital
required to: obtain licenses to use new frequencies; deploy wireless networks to offer voice and
data services; expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services; and obtain new
subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow
the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional
capital necessary to implement or expand 3G wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely
affected if this occurs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>If wireless phones pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our
products and those of our licensees and customers may decrease.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect
of discouraging the use of wireless phones, which would decrease demand for our products and those
of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have
updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio
equipment, including wireless phones. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC
investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause
interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns have also been expressed over
the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless
phones while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of
concern could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers in the United
States as well as foreign countries.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our OmniTRACS and OmniVision systems currently operate in the United States market on leased
Ku-band satellite transponders. Our primary data satellite transponder and position reporting
satellite transponder lease runs through October&nbsp;2012 and includes transponder and satellite
protection (back-up capacity in the event of a transponder or satellite failure), which we believe
will provide sufficient transponder capacity for our United States OmniTRACS and OmniVision
operations through fiscal 2012. A failure to maintain adequate satellite capacity could harm our
business, operating results, liquidity and financial position. QWBS terrestrial-based products rely
on various wireless terrestrial communication networks operated by third parties. The
unavailability or nonperformance of these network systems could harm our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a
Disaster Recovery Plan for our internal information technology networking systems, our systems are
vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural
disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. Any system failure, accident or security
breach that causes interruptions in our operations or to our customers&#146; or licensees&#146; operations
could result in a material disruption to our business. To the extent that any disruption or
security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers&#146; data or applications, or
inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In
addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or
security breaches.

located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Both centers, operated by us, are subject to system failures, which
could interrupt the services and have an adverse effect on our operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we install new or upgraded business management systems. To the extent such

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;24, 2006, we have remaining authority to repurchase up to $0.9&nbsp;billion of our
common stock, net of outstanding put options. There can be no assurance that stock repurchases will
create value for stockholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below
the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Our stock purchase program is intended to
deliver stockholder value over the long-term, but short-term stock price fluctuations can reduce
the program&#146;s effectiveness.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our stock repurchase program, we may sell put options or engage in structured
derivative transactions to reduce the cost of repurchasing stock. In the event of a significant and
unexpected drop in stock price, these arrangements may require us to repurchase stock at price
levels that are significantly above the then-prevailing market price of our stock. Such

may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements,
including those related to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution
channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, changes in
federal income tax law and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments may change from

of our activities, including changes in the allocation of available spectrum by the United States

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our board members, executive
officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability
to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. In addition, implementing our
product and business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, and our revenues
are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for such specialized
engineering and other talented employees in our industry is extremely competitive. In addition,
existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled
foreign national graduates of U.S. universities, making the pool of available talent even smaller.
Key employees represent a significant asset, and the competition for these employees is intense in
the wireless communications industry. In the event of a labor shortage, or in the event of an
unfavorable change in prevailing labor and/or immigration laws, we could experience difficulty
attracting and retaining qualified employees. We continue to anticipate increases in human
resources, particularly in engineering, through fiscal 2007. If we are unable to attract and retain
the qualified employees that we need, our business may be harmed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in periods of poor

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception, we have used stock options and other long-term equity incentives as a
fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options and
other long-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder
value and, using long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. To the extent that new
regulations make it less attractive to grant options to employees, we may incur increased
compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain
and motivate employees, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or
practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting
of transactions completed before the change is effective. New and often complex accounting
pronouncements, taxation rules, and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and
taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public
disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. New or changed laws, regulations
and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases. As a result, their application
in practice may evolve over time. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate
governance and public disclosure. Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal
requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and
procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance
activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ
from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to
practice, our reputation might also be harmed. In addition, it has become more difficult and more
expensive for us to obtain director and officer
liability insurance, and we have purchased reduced coverage at substantially higher cost than
in the past. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer could
face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As
a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive
officers, which could harm our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that requires the approval of holders of
at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock as a condition to certain mergers or other business
transactions with, or proposed by, a holder of 15% or more of our voting stock. Under our charter
documents, stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings of our stockholders or to act by
written consent. These charter provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an
actual or potential change in our control, including those offering stockholders a premium over
current market prices. These provisions may also limit our stockholders&#146; ability to approve
transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

our Board of Directors has the authority under Delaware law to fix the rights and

agreement will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to
acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors. While our Board of Directors approved
our preferred share purchase rights agreement to provide the board with greater ability to maximize
shareholder value, these rights could deter takeover attempts that the board finds inadequate and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated and SnapTrack, Inc.: </I>On March
30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. filed suit against us and SnapTrack, Inc.
(SnapTrack), a QUALCOMM wholly-owned subsidiary, in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the alleged
infringement of three patents. Following a verdict and finding of no infringement of Zoltar&#146;s
patent claims, the Court entered a judgment in favor of us and SnapTrack on Zoltar&#146;s complaint and
awarded us and SnapTrack our costs of suit. Zoltar filed a notice of appeal that was dismissed as
premature. While we have already obtained a verdict of non-infringement of Zoltar&#146;s patents, our
additional affirmative claims seeking declarations of the non-enforceability and invalidity of
those patents were set to be retried in the same Court on October&nbsp;10, 2006. However, Zoltar has
informed the Court that it will covenant not to sue us or SnapTrack on the patents. The final form
of dismissal and judgment in favor of us and SnapTrack remains to be determined.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Whale Telecom Ltd. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On November&nbsp;15, 2004, Whale Telecom Ltd. sued us
in the New York State Supreme Court, County of New York, seeking monetary damages based on the
claim that we fraudulently induced it to enter into certain infrastructure services agreements in
1999 and later interfered with their performance of those agreements. On March&nbsp;15, 2006, the Court
dismissed all claims against us. The plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On May&nbsp;18, 2005, Broadcom filed two actions in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us alleging
infringement of ten patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On
the same date, Broadcom also filed a complaint in the United States International Trade Commission
(ITC)&nbsp;alleging infringement of five of the same patents at issue in the Central District Court
cases seeking a determination and relief under Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. On July&nbsp;1,
2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
against us alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws as well
as common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip sales activities, seeking monetary
damages and
injunctive relief based thereon. On September&nbsp;1, 2006, the New Jersey District Court dismissed
the complaint; Broadcom has filed notice of appeal. Discovery is underway in one of the Central
District Court patent actions, with trial scheduled for May&nbsp;2007. On December&nbsp;12, 2005, the Central
District Court ordered two of the Broadcom patent claims filed in the other Central District patent
action (which is stayed pending completion of the ITC action) to be transferred to the Southern
District of California to be considered in the case filed by us on August&nbsp;22, 2005. That case now
contains additional related claims filed by us and Broadcom. On February&nbsp;14, 2006, the ITC hearing
commenced as to three of the patents alleged. On October&nbsp;10, 2006, the Administrative Law Judge
(ALJ)&nbsp;issued an interim decision in which he recommended against downstream remedies, and found no
infringement by us on two of the three remaining patents and most of the asserted claims of the
third patent. The ALJ did find infringement on some claims of one patent. We will petition the
Commission for review of at least the limited infringement findings and patent validity findings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation: </I>On July&nbsp;11, 2005, we filed an action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom alleging
infringement of seven patents, each of which is essential to the practice of either the GSM or
802.11 standards, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September
23, 2005, Broadcom answered and counterclaimed, alleging infringement of six patents. On October
14, 2005, we filed another action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California against Broadcom alleging infringement of two patents, each of which relates to video
encoding and decoding for high-end multimedia processing, and seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief based thereon. That action is scheduled for trial in January&nbsp;2007. On March&nbsp;24,
2006, we filed another action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California, alleging that Broadcom, during the period in which it has been attempting to bring to
market a WCDMA baseband solution, misappropriated our confidential and trade secret information
relating to our WCDMA baseband chips, and relating to our multimedia capabilities for such chips.
The complaint also asserts another patent claim against Broadcom&#146;s wireless local area network
products, including such capability bundled with Broadcom&#146;s WCDMA product offerings. Broadcom
counterclaimed with the assertion of two patents. On October&nbsp;27, 2006, the Court issued a
preliminary injunction against Broadcom, prohibiting the future use or solicitation of certain of
our confidential business and technical documents and information.

2005, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, filed an action in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of California against Nokia alleging infringement of
eleven of our patents and one SnapTrack patent relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE and position location and
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently stayed pending a decision by
the Federal Circuit regarding Nokia&#146;s arbitration demand. On May&nbsp;24, 2006, we filed an action in
the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for England and Wales against Nokia alleging
infringement of two of our patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology seeking monetary damages
and injunctive relief. On June&nbsp;9, 2006, we filed a complaint with the ITC against Nokia alleging
importation of products that infringe six of our patents relating to power control, video encoding
and decoding, and power conservation mode technologies and seeking an exclusionary order and a
cease and desist order. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, the ITC commenced an investigation. On August&nbsp;9, 2006, we
filed an action in the District Court of Dusseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany, against Nokia
alleging infringement of two of our patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief. On October&nbsp;9, 2006, we filed an action in the High Court of Paris,
France against Nokia alleging infringement of two patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October&nbsp;9, 2006, we filed an action in the Milan
Court, Italy against Nokia alleging infringement of two patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE
technology seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.

in those cases.

anti-trust regulations. To date, we have not received the complaints.

would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position,
we believe the claims made by other parties are without merit and will vigorously defend the
actions. We have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with the legal
proceedings described above based on our belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable.
Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. We are engaged in numerous
other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business and believe that the ultimate
outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its operating results,
liquidity or financial position. In addition, some matters that have previously been disclosed may
no longer be described in this Annual Report because of rulings in the case, settlements, changes
in our business or other developments rendering them, in our judgment, no longer material to our

had been included, the average price paid per share for the purchases of shares made during the

telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We
derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from license fees and
royalties for use of our intellectual property, from services and related hardware sales and from
software development and licensing and related services. Operating expenses primarily consist of
cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: QUALCOMM
CDMA Technologies, or QCT; QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, or QTL; QUALCOMM Wireless &#038; Internet, or
QWI; and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, or QSI.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software
for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system
products. QCT&#146;s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices,
particularly mobile phones, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for
wireless phones include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF)&nbsp;and Power Management
(PM)&nbsp;devices. These integrated circuits for wireless phones and system software perform voice and
data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and
baseband signals and power management. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system
software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless operator&#146;s equipment
providing wireless standards-compliant processing of voice and data signals to and from wireless
phones. QCT&#146;s system software enables the other phone components to interface with the integrated
circuit products and is the foundation software enabling phone manufacturers to develop handsets
utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. In addition to the key components in a
wireless system, QCT provides system reference designs and development tools to assist in
customizing wireless phones and user interfaces, to integrate our products with components
developed by others, and to test interoperability with existing and planned networks. QCT revenues
comprised 58%, 58% and 64% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate
foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made.
Integrated circuits are die, cut from silicon wafers, that have completed the assembly and final
test manufacturing processes. Die, cut from silicon wafers, are the essential components of all of
our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We rely on
independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the
testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most
of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. The majority of our
integrated circuits are purchased on a turnkey basis, in which our foundry suppliers are
responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. We also employ a
two-stage manufacturing business model in which we purchase completed die directly from
semiconductor manufacturing foundries, and directly manage and contract with third party
manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing
business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). IBM, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company, Ltd. and United Microelectronics are the primary foundry suppliers for our family of
baseband integrated circuits. Atmel, Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductor) and IBM are the
primary foundry suppliers for our family of analog, radio frequency and power management integrated
circuits. Our fabless model provides us the flexibility to select suppliers that offer advanced
process technologies to manufacture, assemble and test our integrated circuits at a competitive
price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD
and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives revenue from license fees as well as
ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our
intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing
royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed
products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT,
etc.). QTL revenues comprised 35%, 32% and 27% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues has been generated primarily through our
licensees&#146; sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QWI, which includes QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), QUALCOMM Internet Services
(QIS)&nbsp;and QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV), generates revenues primarily through mobile
communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and
delivery of wireless applications. QWBS provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data
messaging, position reporting and wireless application services to transportation companies,
private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. QIS provides
BREW-based (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products that include user interface and
content delivery and management products and services for the wireless industry. QIS
also provides QChat and QPoint products and services. QChat enables virtually instantaneous
push-to-talk functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices while QPoint enables operators to offer
E-911 and location-based applications and

strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and services. Our
strategy is to invest in CDMA-based operators, licensed device manufacturers and start-up companies
that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction of new
CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary
expects to offer a nationwide multicasting network based on our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology.
This network is expected to be utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their
customers in the United States. The commercial availability of the MediaFLO USA network and service
will be determined by our wireless operator partners. MediaFLO USA&#146;s network will use the 700 MHz
spectrum for which we hold licenses for a nationwide footprint. Additionally, MediaFLO USA plans to
procure, aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will make available on a
wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers (whether they operate on CDMA or GSM/WCDMA
networks) in the United States. Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships are
expected to remain services provided by our wireless operator partners. As part of our strategic
investment activities, we may consider various corporate structuring and exit strategies at some
point in the future, which may include distribution of our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to
our stockholders in a spin-off transaction.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from customers in South Korea, Japan, China and the United States comprised 32%, 21%,
17% and 13%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to 37%, 21%,
11% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2005, and 43%, 18%, 7% and 21%, respectively, in fiscal 2004.
We distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location.
Revenues from customers in China increased as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal 2006 and in
fiscal 2005, as compared to the prior years, primarily due to the maturing of CDMA-based
manufacturers in China that are experiencing wider adoption of their products in international
markets for low priced CDMA2000 phones and WCDMA phones. Combined revenues from customers in South
Korea, Japan and the United States decreased as a percentage of total revenues, from 82% in fiscal
2004 to 76% in fiscal 2005 and 66% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to increases in the percentage of
revenues from WCDMA manufacturers in Western Europe and increased activity by manufacturers in
China.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources
are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and
judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and
investments, share-based payments, income taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on
historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree
of uncertainty. Actual results that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse
effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant
accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than
others.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products,
from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, from messaging and other services
and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. The
timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends
upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our
deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized
involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but it is possible that actual
results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for customer incentive
programs, including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such
reductions to revenue are estimates, which are based on a number of factors, including our
assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual
provisions of our customer agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless
products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD
and/or the OFDMA standards and their derivatives. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or
more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our
licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future
benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn royalties on such licensed
CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees&#146; sales occur. Our
licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after
the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly,
payment is on a semi-annual basis. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,
we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated
Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such
amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to escalating and changing
business trends, we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the
Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and
global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global
competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories
of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues
solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of
recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing
royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. </I></B>Our business acquisitions typically result in
the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may
become impaired in the future. As of September&nbsp;24, 2006, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of
accumulated amortization, were $1.2&nbsp;billion and $450&nbsp;million, respectively. The determination of
the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets
when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and
future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our
businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this
assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows,
volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these
estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an
impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot
predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might
have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired
businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results
of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">that a decline is other-than-temporary is
subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor
operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value
of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing a
publicly-traded investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors
as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original
cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the
performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within
the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations. We also review the financial
statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. In
the event our judgments change as to other-than-temporary declines in value, we may record an
impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $15&nbsp;million, $12&nbsp;million and $12&nbsp;million, respectively, in
other-than-temporary losses on our minority investments in publicly-traded companies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to
determine. These investments totaled $94&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;24, 2006. We record impairment
charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other-than-temporary. The
determination that a decline is other-than-temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in
losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring
impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private companies for an
other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the share
price from the investee&#146;s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to
its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee&#146;s revenue and cost trends, the
investee&#146;s liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate, and market acceptance of the
investee&#146;s products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party evaluations,
valuation reports or advice from investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the
investee may have forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the investee
or the investee&#146;s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the
investee operates. In the event our judgments change as to other-than temporary declines in value,
we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we recorded $4&nbsp;million and $1&nbsp;million, respectively, in
other-than-temporary losses on our investments in private companies. Such losses were not
significant in fiscal 2004.

directors under our stock option plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common
stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month
offering period under our employee stock purchase plans. The benefits provided under these plans
are share-based payments subject to the provisions of revised Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;123 (FAS 123R), &#147;Share-Based Payment.&#148; Effective September&nbsp;26, 2005, we use the fair
value method to apply the provisions of FAS 123R with a modified prospective application which
provides for certain changes to the method for estimating the value of share-based compensation.
The valuation provisions of FAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the
effective date, which are subsequently modified or cancelled. Under the modified prospective
application method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Share-based
compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for fiscal 2006 was $495&nbsp;million. At September&nbsp;24,
2006, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted
prior to that date was $1.2&nbsp;billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.7&nbsp;years. Net stock options, after forfeitures and cancellations, granted during fiscal
2006 represented 1.9% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period. Total stock
options granted during fiscal 2006 represented 2.1% of outstanding shares as of the end of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon adoption of FAS 123R, we began estimating the value of stock option awards on the date of
grant using a lattice binomial option-pricing model (binomial model). Prior to the adoption of FAS
123R, the value of all share-based awards was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Black-Scholes model) for the pro forma information required to
be disclosed under FAS 123. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on
the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but
are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of FAS 123R in future
periods, the compensation expense that we record under FAS 123R may differ significantly from what
we have recorded in the current period. Therefore, we believe it is important for investors to be
aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option-pricing models to estimate
share-based compensation under FAS 123R. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating
the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions, are fully transferable
and do not cause dilution. Because our share-based payments have characteristics significantly
different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values, in our opinion, existing valuation
models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures
of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards. Consequently, there is a risk that our
estimates of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear
little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination
or forfeiture of those share-based payments in the future. Certain share-based payments, such as
employee stock options, may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as
compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated
financial statements. Alternatively, value may be realized from these instruments that are
significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in
our consolidated financial statements. There is not currently a market-based mechanism or other
practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these
valuation models, nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values.
Although the fair value of employee share-based awards is determined in accordance with FAS 123R
and the Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107 (SAB 107), using an
option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing
buyer/willing seller market transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of share-based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial
statements, but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the
payment of cash by us. For this reason, and because we do not view share-based compensation as
related to our operational performance, we exclude estimated share-based compensation expense when
evaluating the business performance of our operating segments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidance in FAS 123R and SAB 107 is relatively new, and best practices are not well
established. The application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and
refinement over time. There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a
possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack
of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share-based
payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different
models, methods and assumptions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical valuation models and market-based methods are evolving and may result in lower or
higher fair value estimates for share-based compensation. The timing, readiness, adoption, general
acceptance, reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain. Sophisticated mathematical
models may require voluminous historical information, modeling expertise, financial analyses,
correlation analyses, integrated software and databases, consulting fees, customization and testing
for adequacy of internal controls. Market-based methods are emerging that, if employed by us, may
dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative
expenses. The uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the
benefits to investors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 using
the binomial model, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the
expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model, consistent with the guidance in FAS
123R and SAB 107. We utilized the term structure of
volatility up to approximately two years, and the implied volatility of the option with the
longest time to maturity was used for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two
years. The weighted-average volatility assumption was 30.7% for fiscal 2006, which if increased to
37%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during
fiscal 2006 by $1.66 per share, or 11%. The volatility percentage assumed for fiscal 2006 was based
on the implied volatility of traded options, as compared to the blend of implied and historical
volatility data used in prior years. FAS 123R includes implied volatility in its list of factors
that should be considered in estimating expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more
useful than historical volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally
reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from
historical volatility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">assumption was 4.6% for fiscal 2006, which if increased to

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not target a specific dividend yield for our dividend payments, but we are required to
assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based
on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield assumption was 1.0% for
fiscal 2006, which if decreased to 0.4%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value
of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 by $0.89 per share, or 6%. Dividends and/or increases
or decreases in dividend payments are subject to board approval as well as to future cash inflows
and outflows resulting from operating performance, stock repurchase programs, mergers and
acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our historical dividend rate is assumed to
continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial change, and investors should not depend
upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to
investors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation

options granted during fiscal 2006 by $0.88 per share, or 6%.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information. The
weighted-average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was 1.7 for fiscal 2006, which if increased
to 2.0, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during
fiscal 2006 by $1.06 per share, or 7%.

subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we believe
we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the
potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As part of our assessment of
potential adjustments to our tax returns, we increase our current tax liability to the extent an
adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an
adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment. We continually assess the likelihood and amount
of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and
deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although
we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable,
adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax
provisions and recorded assets and liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation
allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing
of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning
strategies. As of September&nbsp;24, 2006, gross deferred tax assets were $914&nbsp;million. If we are unable
to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a
material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying
temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation
allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax
rate and an adverse impact on operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;24,
2006, we had gross deferred tax assets of $267&nbsp;million related to capital
loss carryforwards. We can only use capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our
assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we
expect that our future capital gains will not
be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal 2006.
Therefore, we have provided a $16&nbsp;million valuation allowance for the portion of
capital losses we do not expect to utilize. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing
and amount of future capital gains and the timing of realization of capital losses. Adjustments to
our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are
reflected in the period the change is made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash
generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for
United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately
$2.7&nbsp;billion as of September&nbsp;24, 2006. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to
adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of
foreign subsidiaries is made.

2006, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital
stock of Flarion Technologies, Inc. (Flarion), a privately held developer of Orthogonal Frequency

consisting of approximately $349&nbsp;million in shares of QUALCOMM stock, $229&nbsp;million in cash, and the
exchange of Flarion&#146;s existing vested options and warrants with an estimated aggregate fair value
of approximately $35&nbsp;million. In addition, we assumed Flarion&#146;s existing unvested options
with an estimated aggregate fair value of $63&nbsp;million, which is recorded as share-based
compensation over the requisite service period pursuant to FAS 123R. Upon achievement of certain
agreed upon milestones during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we incurred additional
aggregate consideration of $197&nbsp;million, consisting of approximately $185&nbsp;million in cash (of which
$75&nbsp;million will be payable in July&nbsp;2007), $8&nbsp;million in shares of QUALCOMM stock (of which $3
million is issuable in March&nbsp;2007), and the modification of Flarion&#146;s existing vested options and
warrants with an estimated incremental fair value of approximately $4&nbsp;million. The additional
amounts payable in cash and shares on the milestone date were treated as additional consideration
and recorded as goodwill. In addition, the modification of Flarion&#146;s existing unvested options
resulted in an estimated incremental fair value of $7&nbsp;million, which will be recorded as
share-based compensation over the requisite service period pursuant to FAS 123R. The acquisition of
Flarion is intended to broaden our ability to effectively support operators who may
prefer an OFDMA or a hybrid OFDM/CDMA/WCDMA network alternative. The addition of Flarion&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by
corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances
and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on QSI
investments in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from a $48&nbsp;million gain on our minority investment in
a wireless publisher and a $41&nbsp;million gain on the sale of our investment in a wireless
telecommunications company. Losses and gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2006 and 2005,
respectively, related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection
with our stock repurchase program. The change in equity in losses of investees resulted primarily
from the decrease in losses recognized by Inquam, of which our share was $20&nbsp;million and $33
million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, partially offset by the effect of investment gains
recognized by a venture fund investee in 2005, of which our share was $8&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Tax Expense. </I></B>Income tax expense from continuing operations was $686&nbsp;million for fiscal
2006, compared to $666&nbsp;million for fiscal 2005. The annual effective tax rate for continuing
operations was approximately 22% for fiscal 2006, compared to 24% for fiscal 2005. The annual
effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was lower than the annual effective
tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in foreign
earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 13% lower than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 17% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, 1% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from
our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 1% related to research and
development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 5% and other permanent
differences of 1%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;24,
2006, we had a valuation allowance of $16&nbsp;million on
previously incurred capital losses due to uncertainty as to our ability to generate sufficient
capital gains to utilize all capital losses. We will continue to assess the realizability of
capital losses. The amount of the valuation allowance on capital losses may be adjusted in the
future as our ability to utilize capital losses changes. A change in the valuation allowance may
impact the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenues. </I></B>Total revenues for fiscal 2005 were $5.67&nbsp;billion, compared to $4.88&nbsp;billion for
fiscal 2004. Revenues from three customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments comprised an aggregate
of 39% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, compared to 40% of total consolidated
revenues in fiscal 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2005 were $3.74&nbsp;billion, compared to
$3.51&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $165&nbsp;million,
resulting primarily from an increase of $396&nbsp;million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and
accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $241&nbsp;million related to the
effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from the sale of
satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging systems and related messaging services
increased $25&nbsp;million and revenues from the sale of satellite portable phones that operate on the
Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite communications system increased $19&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2005 were $1.93&nbsp;billion, compared to $1.37
billion for fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the QTL segment recorded royalty revenues solely based
on royalties reported by licensees during the year, as compared to the method used during the first
three quarters of fiscal 2004 of recording royalty revenues from certain licensees based on
estimates of royalty revenues earned by those licensees during the quarter. The increase in royalty
revenue year to year resulted primarily from a $350&nbsp;million increase in royalties reported to us by
our external licensees and the effect of changing the timing of
recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151&nbsp;million
of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but
estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by
external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64&nbsp;billion, as compared to $1.29&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2004.
The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in
sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at
higher average selling prices due primarily to the growth in sales of high-end WCDMA products and
shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2005 was
$1.65&nbsp;billion, compared to $1.48&nbsp;billion for fiscal 2004. Cost of equipment and services revenues
as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 44% for fiscal 2005, compared to 42% for
fiscal 2004. The margin percentage decline in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due
to a 1.3% decrease in QCT margin percentage. Increases in product support costs and the reserves
for excess and obsolete inventory contributed 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively, to the total decrease in
QCT margin percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2005, research and development expenses were
$1.01&nbsp;billion or 18% of revenues, compared to $720&nbsp;million or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2004. The
dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $275
million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products and other
initiatives to support lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet
access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X,
1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA, GSM/GPRS/EDGE and OFDMA, and the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO
MDS and iMoD display products using MEMS technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. </I></B>For fiscal 2005, selling, general and
administrative expenses were $631&nbsp;million or 11% of revenues, compared to $547&nbsp;million or 11% of
revenues for fiscal 2004. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $38&nbsp;million increase in
professional fees, primarily patent administration and outside consultants, a $33&nbsp;million increase
in employee-related expenses, and a $13&nbsp;million decrease in other income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by
corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances
and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on corporate
investments increased primarily as a result of an increase in the positive performance of
marketable equity securities as a percentage of total corporate investments in fiscal 2005, as
compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in net realized gains on strategic investments in QSI
resulted primarily from a $48&nbsp;million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and a
$41&nbsp;million gain on the sale of our investment in a wireless telecommunications company. Gains on
derivative instruments in fiscal 2005 and 2004 related primarily to changes in the fair values of
put options sold in connection with our stock
repurchase program. Equity in losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease in
losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $33&nbsp;million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $59
million for fiscal 2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Tax Expense. </I></B>Income tax expense from continuing operations was $666&nbsp;million for fiscal
2005, compared to $588&nbsp;million for fiscal 2004. The annual effective tax rate for continuing
operations was approximately 24% for fiscal 2005, compared to 25% for fiscal 2004. The annual
effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was lower than the annual effective
tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in foreign
earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 11% lower than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 10% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, 3% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from
our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 2% related to research and
development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;25, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $62&nbsp;million on

increase in equipment and services revenue was primarily comprised of an increase of $1.34&nbsp;billion
related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $349&nbsp;million related to the
effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 207&nbsp;million
MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2006, compared to approximately 151&nbsp;million for

billion for fiscal 2005. QTL&#146;s operating margin percentage was 91% in fiscal 2006 as compared to
90% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily resulted from
a $774&nbsp;million increase in royalties reported to us by our licensees which were $2.42&nbsp;billion in
fiscal 2006, compared to $1.64&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in royalty revenue relates to
the increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and the impact of the expiration of one
of our royalty sharing obligations. Revenues from amortized license fees were $50&nbsp;million in fiscal
2006, compared to $69&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment

fiscal 2005. Revenues increased primarily due to a $41&nbsp;million increase in QIS revenue, partially
offset by a decrease in QWBS revenue of $12&nbsp;million. The increase in QIS revenue was primarily
attributable to a $28&nbsp;million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and
products and a $17&nbsp;million increase in QChat revenue resulting from increased development efforts
under the licensing agreement with Sprint. The decrease in QWBS revenue was primarily attributable
to a $26&nbsp;million decrease in equipment revenue, which includes a $19&nbsp;million decrease in
amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales, partially offset by a $14
million increase in messaging services revenue. QWBS shipped approximately 42,100 satellite-based
systems and 39,600 terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2006, compared to approximately 46,800
satellite-based systems and 62,500 terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2005.

fiscal 2005. QWI&#146;s operating margin percentage was 12% in fiscal 2006, compared to 9% in fiscal
2005. The increase in QWI
earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $39&nbsp;million increase in QIS gross margin largely
resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and
QChat development efforts, partially offset by the effect of a $13&nbsp;million increase in QWI research
and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in QWI&#146;s operating

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">before taxes primarily resulted from a $350
million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees and the effect of changing
the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues
recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151&nbsp;million of royalties that were reported by external licensees
in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64&nbsp;billion,
compared to $1.29&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2004. The increase in royalties reported to us by external
licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from
higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at higher average selling prices due primarily to the
growth of higher priced WCDMA sales and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA
products. Revenues from amortized license fees were $69&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005, as compared to $59
million in fiscal 2004. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the
royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in
which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not
all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to
reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing
trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market
share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the
integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees
during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively
and had the initial one-time effect of reducing
royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Accordingly, we did not
estimate royalty revenues earned in fiscal 2005.

fiscal 2004. Revenues increased primarily due to a $37&nbsp;million increase in QIS revenue and a $27
million increase in QWBS revenue. The increase in QIS revenue was primarily attributable to a $41
million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. The increase in
QWBS revenue was primarily attributable to a $16&nbsp;million increase in equipment revenue, net of a
$24&nbsp;million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales,
and a $10&nbsp;million increase in related messaging services revenue. QWBS shipped approximately 46,800

During fiscal 2005, QSI recorded $101&nbsp;million in realized gains on marketable securities and other

consolidated basis, were 29&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;24, 2006, compared to 30&nbsp;days at September&nbsp;25, 2005.
The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2006 as

receipts for royalty receivables. The change in days sales outstanding is consistent with the
increases in revenue and accounts receivable.

The accounting provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for us beginning October&nbsp;1, 2007. The
cumulative effect of initially adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to opening
retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately. Only tax positions that
meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon
adoption of FIN 48. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of FIN 48
will have on our consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest Rate Risk. </I></B>We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and
non-investment grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents and
marketable securities. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the
principal values and yields of fixed income investments. If interest rates in the general economy
were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed income investments could lose value. If
the general economy were to weaken significantly, the credit profile of issuers of securities held
in our investment portfolios could deteriorate, and our investments could lose value. We may
implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs
that do not perform well.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes in interest rates. For our interest-bearing securities, the table presents principal cash
flows, weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed
that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these
securities for presentation purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Equity Price Risk. </I></B>We invest in a number of diversified marketable securities and mutual
fund shares subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities
increased to $1.34&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;24, 2006 from $1.16&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;25, 2005. The
recorded value of equity mutual fund shares increased to $1.52&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;24, 2006 from
$293&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;25, 2005. Our diversified investments in companies and industry segments
may vary over time, and changes in the concentrations of these investments may affect the price
volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity
securities and equity mutual fund shares at September&nbsp;24, 2006 would cause a corresponding 10%
decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities, or $285&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private
early-stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that
our exposure to market risk from
these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not anticipate any near-term changes in
the nature of our market risk exposures or in management&#146;s objectives and strategies with respect
to managing such exposures. The recorded values of these strategic investments totaled $93&nbsp;million
at September&nbsp;24, 2006, compared to $121&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;25, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sell put options that may require us to
repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices. These written put options subject us to
equity price risk. At September&nbsp;24, 2006, we had two outstanding put options, enabling holders to
purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise for approximately $89&nbsp;million (net of
the option premiums received). The put option liabilities, with a fair value of $19&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;24, 2006, were included in other current liabilities. If the fair value of our common
stock at September&nbsp;24, 2006 decreased by 10%, the amount required to physically settle the put
options would exceed the fair value of the shares by $21&nbsp;million, net of the $6&nbsp;million in premiums
received.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Foreign Exchange Risk. </I></B>We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign
currency forward and option contracts. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging
or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September&nbsp;24,
2006, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At September&nbsp;24, 2006, the net
recorded value of our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on
royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products was
a liability of $2&nbsp;million. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign
exchange rates

hedged foreign currencies, we would
incur a loss of approximately $3&nbsp;million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of
our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 1 &#150; The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies&#148; for a description of our foreign
currency accounting policies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are
not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency
fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with
certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated
nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses
on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the
recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States
customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect
future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of
the affected currencies.

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in <I>Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework</I>, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September&nbsp;24, 2006.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have completed integrated
audits of QUALCOMM Incorporated&#146;s consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of September&nbsp;24, 2006 in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated
and its subsidiaries (the Company) at September&nbsp;24, 2006 and September&nbsp;25, 2005, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September&nbsp;24,
2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item&nbsp;15(a)(2)<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"> </SUP>presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by

provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in our opinion, management&#146;s assessment, included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September&nbsp;24, 2006 based on criteria established in
<I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September&nbsp;24, 2006, based on criteria established in
<I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the COSO. The Company&#146;s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management&#146;s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>The Company. </I></B>QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM), a Delaware corporation,
develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and
services. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA)-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications,
multimedia functions and global positioning system products to wireless device and infrastructure
manufacturers. The Company also manufactures and sells products based upon Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA)&nbsp;technology, e.g. FLASH-OFDM. The Company grants licenses to
use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential
to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, and receives license
fees as well as ongoing royalties based on sales by licensees of wireless telecommunications
equipment products incorporating its patented technologies. Currently, the vast majority of the
Company&#146;s license fees and royalty revenue is comprised of fees and royalties from companies
selling wireless products incorporating the Company&#146;s CDMA technologies, but the Company has also
licensed its patented OFDMA technology. The Company provides satellite- and terrestrial-based
two-way data messaging and position reporting services for transportation companies, private
fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. The Company provides the BREW
(Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) product and services to wireless network operators,
handset manufacturers and application developers and support for developing and delivering
over-the-air wireless applications and services. The Company also makes strategic investments to
promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and Internet data
communications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Principles of Consolidation. </I></B>The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the
assets, liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries. The ownership of the
other interest holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest and is not
significant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements one
month in arrears to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements. The Company does not have any investments in entities it believes are
variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company deconsolidated the V&#233;sper Operating Companies and the V&#233;sper Towers during fiscal
2004 as a result of their sale (Note 12). Results of operations related to the V&#233;sper Operating
Companies and the V&#233;sper Towers are presented as discontinued operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Financial Statement Preparation. </I></B>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The Company&#146;s consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal 2004 has been
revised to combine cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing
operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations were previously aggregated and reported in a
separate line item in the statement of cash flows. Certain other prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Fiscal Year. </I></B>The Company operates and reports using a 52-53&nbsp;week fiscal year ending on the
last Sunday in September. The fiscal years ended September&nbsp;24, 2006, September&nbsp;25, 2005 and
September&nbsp;26, 2004 each included 52&nbsp;weeks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition. </I></B>The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit
products, from royalties for its intellectual property, from messaging and other services and
related hardware sales, from software development and licensing and related services, and from
license fees for intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue
actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of
each arrangement and the nature of the Company&#146;s deliverables and obligations. The development
stage of the Company&#146;s customers&#146; products does not affect the timing or amount of revenue
recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company licenses rights to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain
wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Wideband
CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA Time Division

fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products
incorporating or using the Company&#146;s licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized
over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years.
The Company earns royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by its licensees at the
time that the licensees&#146; sales occur. The Company&#146;s licensees, however, do not report and pay
royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter, and, in
some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis.
During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company estimated and recorded
the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter
in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not
all royalties earned were estimated.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company determined that, due to escalating
and changing business trends, the Company no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty
revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial
launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to
increased global competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished
product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company began
recognizing royalty revenues for a quarter solely based on royalties reported by licensees during
such quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and
had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of the Company&#146;s CDMA-based integrated circuits are recognized at the time
of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue
recognition are met, if later. Revenues from providing services are recorded when earned.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes revenues allocated to certain satellite and terrestrial-based two-way
data messaging and position reporting hardware using the
residual method. Revenues from such sales are recorded at the time of shipment, or when title and
risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues
from long-term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs.
The percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs.
Revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in
profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise
to the revision become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of
contract profit would be required. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and
accrued profit are classified as unearned revenue in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets.
Estimated contract losses are recognized when determined. If substantive uncertainty related to
customer acceptance exists or the contract&#146;s duration is relatively short, the Company uses the
completed-contract method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides both perpetual and renewable time-based software licenses. Revenues from
software license fees are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: the written
agreement is executed; the software is delivered; the license fee is fixed and determinable;
collectibility of the license fee is probable; and if applicable, when vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of multiple-element arrangements,
including post-contract customer support. When contracts contain multiple elements wherein
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements, the Company
recognizes revenue for the delivered elements and defers revenue for the fair value of the
undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied. If vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, revenue for the
delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining obligations have been satisfied, or
if the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support and vendor specific objective
evidence of the fair value of post-contract customer support does not exist, revenue from the
entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. Judgments and estimates are made
in connection with the recognition of software license revenue, which may include assessments of
collectibility, the fair value of deliverable elements and the implied support period. The amount
or timing of the Company&#146;s software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in these
judgments or estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special

customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of the customer agreements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products, license fees for
intellectual property and hardware products sales with continuing performance obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Concentrations. </I></B>A significant portion of the Company&#146;s revenues is concentrated with a limited
number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless telecommunications products is dominated
by a small number of large corporations. Revenues from three customers of the Company&#146;s QCT, QTL
and QWI segments, each comprised an aggregate of 13% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006,
compared to 15%, 13% and 11% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 and 15%, 15% and 10% of
total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004. Aggregated accounts receivable from these three
customers comprised 45% of gross accounts receivable at September&nbsp;24, 2006 and September&nbsp;25, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from international customers were approximately 87%, 82% and 79% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cost of Equipment and Services Revenues. </I></B>Cost of equipment and services revenues is primarily
comprised of the cost of equipment revenues, the cost of messaging services revenues and the cost
of development and other services revenues. Cost of equipment revenues consists of the cost of
equipment sold and sustaining engineering costs, including personnel and related costs. Cost of
messaging services revenues consists principally of satellite transponder costs, network operations
expenses, including personnel and related costs, depreciation and airtime charges by
telecommunications operators. Cost of development and other services revenues primarily includes
personnel costs and related expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Research and Development. </I></B>Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed
as incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after technological feasibility
of the software is established.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Shipping and Handling Costs. </I></B>Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of
equipment and services revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a
customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes. </I></B>The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in
income in the period such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While the Company believes
it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns, the Company regularly
assesses the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of
its provision for income taxes. As part of its assessment of potential adjustments to its tax
returns, the Company increases its current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result
in a cash tax payment or decreases its deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not
result in a cash tax payment. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of
potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred
taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the adoption of the revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123,
&#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; (FAS 123R) beginning September&nbsp;26, 2005, the Company recognizes windfall tax
benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders&#146; equity only when
realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards
resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from September&nbsp;26, 2005 onward. A windfall tax
benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the Company upon an employee&#146;s disposition
of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that the
Company had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has
been realized, the Company follows the tax law ordering method, under which current year
share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss
carryforwards and other tax attributes.

of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and government agencies&#146; securities. The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Marketable Securities. </I></B>Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value as determined by the most recently traded
price of each security at the balance sheet date. The net unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss), net of
tax. The specific identification method is used to compute the realized gains and losses on debt
and equity securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its marketable
securities. When assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the
Company considers such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a
percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its
original cost, the performance of the investee&#146;s stock price in relation to the stock price of its
competitors within the industry and the market in general, analyst recommendations, any news that
has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the
investee operates. The Company also reviews the financial statements of the investee to determine
if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties and considers new products/services that the
investee may have forthcoming that will improve its operating results. If events and circumstances
indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other-than-temporary, the
Company records a charge to investment income (expense).

estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company&#146;s customers to make required payments.
The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably
assured: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic
industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience
with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from various credit organizations to
ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors. The Company may also request
financial information, including financial statements or other documents (e.g. bank statements) to
ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate
collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured,
which is generally upon receipt of cash. If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers were
to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.

exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventory is
assessed based on review of committed purchase orders from customers, as well as purchase
commitment projections provided by customers, among other things.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Property, Plant and Equipment. </I></B>Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over 30&nbsp;years and 15&nbsp;years, respectively.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging
from 2 to 15&nbsp;years. Direct external and internal costs of developing software for internal use are
capitalized subsequent to the preliminary stage of development. Leased property meeting certain
capital lease criteria is capitalized, and the net present value of the related lease payments is
recorded as a liability. Amortization of capital leased assets is recorded using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Maintenance, repairs, and
minor renewals and betterments are charged to expense as incurred.

(losses)&nbsp;on derivative instruments. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign
currency forward and option contracts that are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as gains (losses)&nbsp;on derivative instruments, net

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Share-Based Payments. </I></B>On September&nbsp;26, 2005, the Company adopted FAS 123R. Under FAS 123R,
share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of
the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee&#146;s requisite service period. The Company
has no awards with market or performance conditions. The Company adopted the provisions of FAS 123R
using a modified prospective application. Accordingly, prior periods have not been revised for
comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of FAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards that
are outstanding on the effective date, which are subsequently modified or cancelled. Estimated
compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date will be recognized over the
remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes
under FASB Statement No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#148; (FAS 123).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.&nbsp;FAS 123(R)-3, &#147;Transition
Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.&#148; The Company has
elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this FASB Staff Position for
calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to FAS 123R. The alternative
transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional
paid-in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation,
which is available to absorb tax deficiencies which could be recognized subsequent to the adoption
of FAS 123R.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon adoption of FAS 123R, the Company also changed its method of valuation for stock options
granted beginning in fiscal 2006 to a lattice binomial option-pricing model (binomial model) from
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Black-Scholes model) which was previously used for the
Company&#146;s pro forma information required under FAS 123. The Company&#146;s employee stock options have
various restrictions that reduce option value, including vesting provisions and restrictions on
transfer and hedging, among others, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity.
Binomial models have evolved such that the currently available models are more capable of
incorporating the features of the Company&#146;s employee stock options than closed-form models such as
the Black-Scholes model.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company used the implied volatility of market-traded options in the Company&#146;s stock
for the expected volatility assumption, consistent with the guidance in FAS 123R and the Securities
and Exchange Commission&#146;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107. The Company utilized the term
structure of volatility up to approximately two years, and the implied volatility of the option
with the longest time to maturity was used for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond
two years. Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company had used a combination of its historical stock price
and implied volatility in accordance with FAS 123 for purposes of its pro forma information. The
selection of implied volatility data to estimate expected volatility was based upon the
availability of actively traded options on the Company&#146;s stock and the Company&#146;s assessment that
implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for
the terms of the Company&#146;s employee stock options. The Company does not target a specific dividend
yield for its dividend payments but is required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the
binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company&#146;s history and expectation of
future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future. The post-vesting
forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factor are based on the Company&#146;s historical option
cancellation and employee exercise information, respectively. The suboptimal exercise factor is the
ratio by which the stock price must increase before employees are expected to exercise their stock
options.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock
options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the binomial model. The
expected life of employee stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions used in
the Company&#146;s model. The binomial model assumes that employees&#146; exercise behavior is a function of
the options&#146; remaining contractual life and the extent to which the option is in-the-money (i.e.
the average stock price during the period is above the strike price of the stock option). The
binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on
the history of exercises and cancellations of past grants made by the Company. The expected life of
employee stock options granted during fiscal 2006 derived from the binomial model was 5.8&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for
fiscal 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it should be reduced for estimated
forfeitures. FAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Pre-vesting
forfeitures were estimated to be approximately 0% in the year ended September&nbsp;24, 2006 based on
historical experience. The effect of pre-vesting forfeitures on the Company&#146;s recorded expense has
historically been negligible due to the predominantly monthly vesting of option grants. If
pre-vesting forfeitures occur in the future, the Company will record the effect of such forfeitures
as the forfeitures occur. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of this
assumption. In the Company&#146;s pro forma information required under FAS 123 for the periods prior to
fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded $86&nbsp;million in share-based compensation expense during fiscal 2006
related to share-based awards granted during fiscal 2006. In addition, for fiscal 2006, the
adoption of FAS 123R resulted in a reclassification to reduce net cash provided by operating
activities by $403&nbsp;million, with an offsetting increase in net cash provided by financing
activities, related to incremental tax benefits from stock options exercised in the period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to adopting the provisions of FAS 123R, the Company recorded estimated compensation
expense for employee stock options based upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant
to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 (APB 25), &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148; and
provided the required pro forma disclosures of FAS 123. Because the Company established the
exercise price based on the fair market value of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of grant, the
stock options had no intrinsic value upon grant, and therefore no estimated expense was recorded
prior to adopting FAS 123R. Each accounting period, the Company reported the potential dilutive
impact of stock options in its diluted earnings per common share using the treasury-stock method.
Out-of-the-money stock options (i.e. the average stock price during the period was below the strike
price of the stock option) were not included in diluted earnings per common share as their effect
was anti-dilutive.

income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of dilutive
common share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under the Company&#146;s share-based compensation
plans and shares subject to written put options, and the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. Dilutive common share equivalents include the dilutive
effect of in-the-money shares, which is calculated based on the average share price for each period
using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the exercise price of a share,
the amount of compensation cost, if any, for future service that the Company has not yet
recognized, and the amount of estimated tax benefits that would be recorded in paid-in capital, if
any, when the share is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period.
The incremental dilutive common share equivalents, calculated using the treasury stock method, for
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were approximately 51,835,000, 56,127,000 and 58,686,000, respectively.

in the earnings per common share computation for fiscal 2005 and 2004 because the put options&#146;

48) &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes&#148; which prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition,
classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax
positions. The accounting provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for the Company beginning October
1, 2007. The cumulative effect of initially adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to
opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately. Only tax
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be
recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The Company is in the process of determining the effect, if
any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

securities consist primarily of investments in certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury securities,
government-sponsored enterprise securities, municipal bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-
and asset-backed securities and corporate bonds and notes. The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s
investments in investment grade debt securities were caused by interest rate increases. Due to the
fact that the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit
quality, and because the severity and duration of the unrealized losses were not significant, the
Company considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September&nbsp;24, 2006.

unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investment in non-investment grade debt securities were caused
by credit quality and industry- or company-specific events. Because the severity and duration of
the unrealized losses were not significant, the Company considered these unrealized losses to be

consist primarily of investments in common stock of large companies and equity mutual funds. The
unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s investment in marketable equity securities were caused by
overall equity market volatility and industry-specific events. The duration and severity of the
unrealized losses in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments were consistent
with typical equity market volatility. Current market forecasts support a recovery of fair value up
to (or beyond) the cost of the investment within a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, the
Company considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September&nbsp;24, 2006.

goodwill (Note 10). The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for annual impairment
testing purposes. Goodwill was allocable to reporting units included in the Company&#146;s reportable
segments at September&nbsp;24, 2006 as follows: $339&nbsp;million in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, $687
million in QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, $76&nbsp;million in QUALCOMM Wireless &#038; Internet, and $128
million in QUALCOMM MEMS Technology (a nonreportable segment included in reconciling items in Note
10). The increase in goodwill from September&nbsp;25, 2005 to September&nbsp;24, 2006 was the result of the
Company&#146;s business acquisitions (Note 11), partially offset by currency translation adjustments.

(Inquam), the owner of a wireless CDMA-based operator in Romania, and in Inquam&#146;s former

and $59&nbsp;million in equity in losses of Inquam during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
including a $12&nbsp;million loss resulting from Inquam&#146;s restructuring during fiscal 2006. At September

Inquam and the Portugal Companies totaled $5&nbsp;million and $26&nbsp;million, respectively, net of
equity in losses. The Company and the Other Investor have each guaranteed 50% of a portion of
amounts owed under certain of Inquam&#146;s long-term financing arrangements, up to a combined maximum
of $53&nbsp;million. The fair value of this obligation, which is insignificant, has been recorded in the
financial statements. The guarantee expires and the facilities mature on December&nbsp;25, 2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has not provided for United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes
on a cumulative total of approximately $2.7&nbsp;billion of undistributed earnings from certain
non-United States subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should the Company
repatriate foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the
period management determined that the Company would repatriate the earnings. On October&nbsp;22, 2004,
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) was signed into law. The Jobs
Creation Act created a temporary incentive for corporations in the United States to repatriate
accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85&nbsp;percent dividends received deduction for
certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the
Company repatriated approximately $0.5&nbsp;billion of foreign earnings qualifying for the special
incentive under the Jobs Creation Act and recorded a related expense of approximately $35&nbsp;million
for federal and state income tax liabilities. This distribution does not change the Company&#146;s
intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries in
operations outside the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2006, the Internal Revenue Service and the California Franchise Tax Board
completed audits of the Company&#146;s tax returns for fiscal 2001 and 2002, resulting in adjustments to
the Company&#146;s net operating loss and credit carryover amounts for those years. The tax provision
was reduced by $73&nbsp;million during fiscal 2006 to reflect the expected impacts of the audits on both the reviewed and open
tax years.

declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company&#146;s
common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, as amended and restated on September
26, 2005, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a one
one-thousandth share of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value
per share, subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, at a purchase price of $180. The
Rights are exercisable only if a person or group (an Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the Company&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock without Board
approval. Upon exercise, holders, other than an Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to
termination, to receive the Company&#146;s common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having
a market value, as defined, equal to twice-such purchase price. The
Rights, which expire on September&nbsp;25, 2015, are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the Company&#146;s option prior to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Stock Repurchase Program. </I></B>On November&nbsp;7, 2005, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to
$2.5&nbsp;billion of the Company&#146;s common stock under a program with no expiration date. The $2.5
billion stock repurchase program replaced a $2.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program, of which
approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion remained authorized for repurchases. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the
Company repurchased and retired 34,000,000 shares and 27,083,000 of common stock for $1.5&nbsp;billion
and $953&nbsp;million, respectively, excluding $5&nbsp;million of premiums received related to put options
that were exercised in fiscal 2006. The Company did not repurchase any of the Company&#146;s common
stock during fiscal 2004. At September&nbsp;24, 2006, approximately $0.9&nbsp;billion remained authorized for
repurchases under the stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Company&#146;s stock repurchase program, the Company sold put options on its
own stock during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. At September&nbsp;24, 2006, the Company had two outstanding
put options enabling holders to sell 2,000,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock to the Company
for approximately $89&nbsp;million (net of the put option premiums received), and the recorded values of
the put option liabilities totaled $19&nbsp;million. In October&nbsp;2006, one of the put options was
exercised, and the Company repurchased and retired 1,000,000 shares of its common stock for
approximately $45&nbsp;million (net of the put option premium received). Upon repurchase, the shares
were retired. The remaining put option, with an expiration date in November&nbsp;2006, may require the
Company to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $45&nbsp;million (net of
the put option premium received). Any shares purchased upon the exercise of the put option will be
retired. During fiscal 2006, the Company recognized $29&nbsp;million in investment losses due to net
increases in the fair values of put options, net of premiums received of $11&nbsp;million. During fiscal
2005 and 2004, the Company recognized gains of $31&nbsp;million and $5&nbsp;million, respectively, in
investment income due to decreases in the fair values of put options, including premiums received
of $15&nbsp;million and $5&nbsp;million, respectively.

units, performance units and shares and other stock-based awards and will be the source of shares
issued under the Executive Retirement Matching Contribution Plan (ERMCP). The share reserve under

increased by the amount equal to the number of shares subject to any outstanding option under a
Prior Plan that is terminated or cancelled (but not an option under a Prior Plan that expires)
following the date that the 2006 Plan was approved by stockholders. Shares that are subject to an
award under the ERMCP and are returned to the Company because they fail to vest will again become
available for grant under the 2006 Plan. The Board of Directors of the Company may amend or
terminate the 2006 Plan at any time. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding

using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company&#146;s stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. At September&nbsp;24, 2006, total
unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to
non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.2&nbsp;billion, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7&nbsp;years. Total share-based compensation cost
capitalized as part of inventory and fixed assets was $1&nbsp;million during fiscal 2006. The total
intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2006 was $1.1&nbsp;billion. The Company
recorded cash received from the exercise of stock options of $608&nbsp;million and related tax benefits
of $421&nbsp;million during fiscal 2006. Upon option exercise, the Company issues new shares of stock.

On March&nbsp;30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. filed suit against QUALCOMM and its
subsidiary SnapTrack, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the alleged infringement of
three patents. Following a verdict and finding of no infringement of Zoltar&#146;s patent claims, the
Court entered a judgment in favor of the Company and SnapTrack on Zoltar&#146;s complaint and awarded
the Company and SnapTrack their costs of suit. Zoltar filed a notice of appeal that was dismissed
as premature. While the Company has already obtained a verdict of non-infringement of Zoltar&#146;s
patents, the Company&#146;s additional affirmative claims seeking declarations of the non-enforceability
and invalidity of those patents were set to be retried in the same Court on October&nbsp;10, 2006.
However, Zoltar has informed the Court that it will covenant not to sue the Company or SnapTrack on
the patents. The final form of dismissal and judgment in favor of the Company and SnapTrack remains
to be determined.

the Company in the New York State Supreme Court, County of New York, seeking monetary damages based
on the claim that the Company fraudulently induced it to enter into certain infrastructure services
agreements in 1999 and later interfered with their performance of those agreements. On March&nbsp;15,
2006, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company. The plaintiff has filed a notice of
appeal.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On May&nbsp;18, 2005, Broadcom filed two actions in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Company
alleging infringement of ten patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based
thereon. On the same date, Broadcom also filed a complaint in the United States International Trade
Commission (ITC)&nbsp;alleging infringement of five of the same patents at issue in the Central District
Court cases seeking a determination and relief under Section&nbsp;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. On July
1, 2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey against the Company alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and unfair
competition laws as well as common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip sales
activities, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September&nbsp;1, 2006, the
New Jersey District Court dismissed the complaint; Broadcom has filed notice of appeal. Discovery
is underway in one of the Central District Court patent actions, with trial scheduled for May&nbsp;2007.
On December&nbsp;12, 2005, the Central District Court ordered two of the Broadcom patent claims filed in
the other Central District patent action (which is stayed pending completion of the ITC action) to
be transferred to the Southern District of California to be considered in the case filed by the
Company on August&nbsp;22, 2005. That case now contains additional related claims filed by the Company
and Broadcom. On February&nbsp;14, 2006, the ITC hearing commenced as to three of the patents alleged.
On October&nbsp;10, 2006, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&nbsp;issued an interim decision in which he
recommended against any downstream remedies, and found no infringement by the Company on two of the
three remaining patents and most of the asserted claims of the third
patent. The ALJ did find infringement on some claims of one patent. The Company will petition
the Commission for review of at least the limited infringement findings and patent validity
findings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation: </I>On July&nbsp;11, 2005, the Company filed an action
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom
alleging infringement of seven patents, each of which is essential to the practice of either the
GSM or 802.11 standards, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On
September&nbsp;23, 2005, Broadcom answered and counterclaimed, alleging infringement of six patents. On
October&nbsp;14, 2005, the Company filed another action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California against Broadcom alleging infringement of two patents, each of
which relates to video encoding and decoding for high-end multimedia processing, and seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. That action is scheduled for trial in January
2007. On March&nbsp;24, 2006, the Company filed another action in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of California, alleging that Broadcom, during the period in which it has been
attempting to bring to market a WCDMA baseband solution, misappropriated QUALCOMM confidential and
trade secret information relating to QUALCOMM&#146;s WCDMA

multimedia capabilities for such chips. The complaint also asserts another patent claim against
Broadcom&#146;s wireless local area network products, including such capability bundled with Broadcom&#146;s
WCDMA product offerings. Broadcom counterclaimed with the assertion of two patents. On October&nbsp;27,
2006, the Court issued a preliminary injunction against Broadcom, prohibiting the future use or
solicitation of certain of the Company&#146;s confidential business and technical documents and
information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QUALCOMM Incorporated and SnapTrack, Inc. v. Nokia Corporation and Nokia Inc.: </I>On November&nbsp;4,
2005, the Company, along with its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack, filed an action in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California against Nokia alleging infringement
of eleven QUALCOMM patents and one SnapTrack patent relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE and position location
and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently stayed pending a decision
by the Federal Circuit regarding Nokia&#146;s arbitration demand. On May&nbsp;24, 2006, the Company filed an
action in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for England and Wales against Nokia
alleging infringement of two QUALCOMM patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief. On June&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed a complaint with the ITC against
Nokia alleging importation of products that infringe six QUALCOMM patents relating to power
control, video encoding and decoding, and power conservation mode technologies and seeking an
exclusionary order and a cease and desist order. On July&nbsp;7, 2006, the ITC commenced an
investigation. On August&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed an action in the District Court of Dusseldorf,
Federal Republic of Germany, against Nokia alleging infringement of two QUALCOMM patents relating
to GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On October&nbsp;9, 2006, the
Company filed an action in the High Court of Paris, France against Nokia alleging infringement of
two patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On
October&nbsp;9, 2006, the Company filed an action in the Milan Court, Italy against Nokia alleging
infringement of two patents relating to GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Nokia Corporation and Nokia Inc. v. QUALCOMM Incorporated: </I>On August&nbsp;9, 2006, Nokia
Corporation and Nokia, Inc. filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court seeking declaratory and
injunctive relief relating to alleged commitments made by the Company to wireless industry
standards setting organizations. The Company has moved to dismiss the complaint.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other: </I>The Company has been named, along with many other manufacturers of wireless phones,
wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in several purported class
action lawsuits, and several individually filed actions pending in Pennsylvania, Washington D.C.,
and Louisiana, seeking monetary damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. The courts that
have reviewed similar claims against other companies to date have held that there was insufficient
scientific basis for the plaintiffs&#146; claims in those cases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;28, 2005, it was reported that six companies (Broadcom, Nokia, Texas Instruments,
NEC, Panasonic and Ericsson) filed complaints with the European Commission, alleging that the
Company violated European Union competition law in its WCDMA licensing practices. The Company has
received the complaints and has submitted a reply.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
has been reported that two U.S. companies (Texas Instruments and
Broadcom) and two South Korean
companies (Nextreaming Corp. and THINmultimedia Inc.) have filed complaints with the Korean Fair
Trade Commission
alleging that the Company&#146;s business practices are, in some way, a violation of South Korean
anti-trust regulations. To date, the Company has not received the complaints.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the claims made by other parties are without merit and will
vigorously defend the actions. The Company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liability
associated with the legal proceedings described above based on the Company&#146;s belief that a
liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated
at this time. The Company is engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of its business and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on its operating results, liquidity or financial position. In addition, some matters
that have previously been disclosed may no longer be described in this Note because of rulings in
the case, settlements, changes in the Company&#146;s business or other developments rendering them, in
the Company&#146;s judgment, no longer material to the Company&#146;s operating results, liquidity or
financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings (loss)&nbsp;before income
taxes (EBT). EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including
depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and
charges are not allocated to segments in the Company&#146;s management reports because they are not
considered in evaluating the segments&#146; operating performance. Unallocated income and charges
include certain investment income, share-based compensation and certain research and development
expenses and marketing expenses that were not deemed to be directly related to the businesses of
the segments. The table below presents revenues, EBT and total assets for reportable segments (in
millions):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segment assets are comprised of accounts receivable and inventories for QCT, QTL and QWI. The
QSI segment assets include certain marketable securities, notes receivable, wireless licenses,
other investments and all assets of QSI&#146;s consolidated subsidiary, MediaFLO USA, including
property, plant and equipment. QSI&#146;s assets related to the MediaFLO USA business totaled $329
million and $98&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;24, 2006 and September&nbsp;25, 2005, respectively. QSI&#146;s assets
also included $19&nbsp;million, $61&nbsp;million and $106&nbsp;million related to investments in equity method
investees at September&nbsp;24, 2006, September&nbsp;25, 2005 and September&nbsp;26, 2004, respectively. Total
segment assets differ from total assets on a consolidated basis as a result of unallocated
corporate assets primarily comprised of cash, cash equivalents, certain marketable securities,
property, plant and equipment, deferred tax assets, goodwill, certain other intangible assets of
nonreportable segments and capitalized share-based compensation. The net book value of long-lived
assets located outside of the United States was $69&nbsp;million, $44&nbsp;million and $21&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;24, 2006, September&nbsp;25, 2005 and September&nbsp;26, 2004, respectively. The net book value of
long-lived assets located in the United States was $1.4&nbsp;billion, $978&nbsp;million and $654&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;24, 2006,
September&nbsp;25, 2005 and September&nbsp;26, 2004, respectively. Reconciling items included $228&nbsp;million
and $188&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;24, 2006 and September&nbsp;25, 2005, respectively, of goodwill and other
assets related to the QUALCOMM MEMS Technologies division (QMT), a nonreportable segment developing

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;18, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding capital
stock of Flarion Technologies, Inc. (Flarion), a privately held developer of OFDMA technology for
approximately $613&nbsp;million in consideration, consisting of approximately $349&nbsp;million in shares of
QUALCOMM stock, $229&nbsp;million in cash, and the exchange of Flarion&#146;s existing vested options and
warrants with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $35&nbsp;million. In addition, the
Company assumed Flarion&#146;s existing unvested options with an estimated aggregate fair value of $63
million, which is recorded as share-based compensation over the requisite service period pursuant
to FAS 123R. Upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones during the third quarter of fiscal
2006, the Company incurred additional aggregate consideration of $197&nbsp;million, consisting of
approximately $185&nbsp;million in cash (of which $75&nbsp;million will be payable in July&nbsp;2007), $8&nbsp;million
in shares of QUALCOMM stock (of which $3&nbsp;million is issuable in March&nbsp;2007), and the modification
of Flarion&#146;s existing vested options and warrants with an estimated incremental fair value of
approximately $4&nbsp;million. The additional amounts payable in cash and shares on the milestone date
were treated as additional consideration and recorded as goodwill. In addition, the modification of
Flarion&#146;s existing unvested options resulted in an estimated incremental fair value of $7&nbsp;million,
which will be recorded as share-based compensation over the requisite service period pursuant to
FAS 123R. The acquisition of Flarion is intended to broaden the Company&#146;s ability to effectively
support operators who may prefer an OFDMA or a hybrid OFDM/CDMA/WCDMA network alternative. The
addition of Flarion&#146;s intellectual property and engineering resources will also supplement the
resources that the Company has already dedicated over the years towards the development of
OFDM/OFDMA technologies.

performance and other milestones are reached. The Company is in the final stages of accounting for
the acquisitions and does not anticipate material adjustments to the preliminary purchase price
allocations. Goodwill recognized in these transactions, no amount of which is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes, was assigned to the QTL and QCT segments in the amounts of $619
million and $38&nbsp;million, respectively. Technology-based intangible assets recognized in the amount
of $165&nbsp;million are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average amortization
period of seventeen years. Purchased in-process technology in the amount of $22&nbsp;million was charged
to research and development expense upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been
established and no future alternative uses existed. The consolidated financial statements include
the operating results of these businesses from their respective dates of acquisition. Pro forma
results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the acquisitions were not
material.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;2, 2003, the Company sold its direct and indirect ownership interests in V&#233;sper
S&#227;o Paulo S.A. and V&#233;sper S.A. (the V&#233;sper Operating Companies), consolidated subsidiaries of the
Company&#146;s QSI segment, and the V&#233;sper Operating Companies&#146; communication towers and related
interests in tower site property leases (V&#233;sper Towers) in two separate transactions. The Company
realized a net loss of $52&nbsp;million on the sale of the V&#233;sper Operating Companies during fiscal
2004, partially offset by a $40&nbsp;million net gain from the subsequent sale of the V&#233;sper Towers. The
Company also recognized a $19&nbsp;million net gain resulting from the extinguishment of debt related to
the waiver and return of personal mobile service licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications
regulatory agency in Brazil. As a result of the disposition of the remaining operations and assets
related to the V&#233;sper Operating Companies, the Company determined that the results of operations
related to the V&#233;sper Operating Companies, including the results related to the V&#233;sper Towers and
the gains and losses realized on the sales transactions, should be presented as discontinued
operations in its consolidated statements of operations. At September&nbsp;24, 2006 and September&nbsp;25,
2005, the Company had no remaining assets or liabilities related to the V&#233;sper Operating Companies
